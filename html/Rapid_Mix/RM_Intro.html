<dt>This chapter is currently home for the prerequisites of successful flocculation. Those prerequisites include:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>ensuring that the pH is in the correct range for coagulant nanoparticle formation after the coagulant has been added to the raw water.</li>
<li>increasing the coagulant dose to account for the coagulant interactions with dissolved species that effectively cover some of the coagulant nanoparticle surfaces.</li>
<li>increasing the coagulant dose to account for the available surface area of suspended particles to achieve</li>
<li>If there are multiple treatment trains, mixing the coagulant with the raw water so that parallel treatment trains receive the same concentration of coagulant (perhaps the conventional role of rapid mix)</li>
<li>transporting the coagulant nanoparticles to attach to suspended particles</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rapid mix is the term commonly used to describe the processes that occur between the coagulant addition to the raw water and the flocculation process. The processes that occur are not well understood and thus design guidelines have been empirical.</p>
<p>“In summary, little is known about rapid mix, much less any sensitivity to scale. However, the models and data reviewed suggest the need to be on the lookout for certain effects. From what is presently known, it can be speculated that since coagulant precipitation is sensitive to both micro- and macro-mixing, scale-up must consider not only energy dissipation rate, but also the reaction injection point and the contacting method.” - <a class="reference external" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Mixing_in_coagulation_and_flocculation.html?id=dkFSAAAAMAAJ">Mixing in Coagulation and Flocculation 1991 page 292</a>.</p>
<p>Although the processes have not been well characterized, the energy that is invested for rapid mix processes is significant. In many cases the amount of energy used isn’t practical for gravity powered water treatment plants. The high energy consumption of rapid mix units has led some municipal water treatment plant operators to experiment with turning off rapid mix units. They have found that at least under some conditions there is no indication that the energy used in rapid mix improved plant performance. Thus there is a need to understand the physical and chemical processes that occur when a concentrated liquid coagulant is added to water.</p>
<p>Rapid mix sets the stage for aggregation of both suspended particles and dissolved substances. Particle and dissolve substance aggregation is mediated by coagulant nanoparticles. The nanoparticles attach to raw water particles as well as to some dissolved species. After the nanoparticles have been mixed with the raw water and have attached to raw water particles the next process, flocculation, can begin.  <a class="reference internal" href="../Flocculation/Floc_Intro.html#title-flocculation-introduction"><span class="std std-ref">Flocculation</span></a> is the process of producing collisions between particles to create flocs (aggregates of particles).</p>
<p>Coagulant nanoparticle application includes multiple steps that must occur before the raw water particles can begin to aggregate. The sticky nanoparticles can be aluminum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((Al^{+3})\)</span> or iron <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((Fe^{+3})\)</span> based and in either case the nanoparticles are formed from precipitated hydroxide species (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al(OH)_3\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Fe(OH)_3\)</span>). The series of events that are contained in the broad designation of “rapid mix” are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Liquid coagulant stock solution with a low pH is injected into the raw water</li>
<li>Fluid Mixing: Turbulent eddies randomize the fluids (but don’t blend them)<ol class="arabic">
<li>Large scale eddies mix the coagulant with the raw water by creating large fluid deformations. This stretching and turning of the raw water and coagulant is analogous to shuffling a deck of cards. The cards are randomized, but the cards maintain their identity. The original liquids retain their chemical composition. This step must be completed before any flow splitting for parallel treatment trains.</li>
<li>Turbulent eddies disintegrate into smaller and smaller eddies.</li>
<li>At a very small scale (Inner viscous length scale) viscosity becomes significant and the kinetic energy of the eddies begins to be converted to heat by viscosity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The coagulant is blended with the raw water by molecular diffusion</li>
<li>The higher pH of the raw water causes the coagulant to begin to precipitate as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al_{12}AlO_4(OH)_{24}(H_2O)_{12}^{7+}\)</span>, an aluminum, Al, nanoparticle.</li>
<li>The precipitating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al_{13}\)</span> molecules aggregates with other nearby <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al_{13}\)</span> molecules to form aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles. It is also possible that the nanoparticles are already formed in the coagulant stock suspension. Polyaluminum chloride stock solutions turn white in about a year at room temperature and this suggests that nanoparticles form in the stock solution.</li>
<li>The Al nanoparticles attach to other dissolved species and suspended particles.</li>
<li>Molecular diffusion causes some dissolved species and Al nanoparticles to aggregate.</li>
<li>Fluid shear and molecular diffusion cause Al nanoparticles with attached formerly dissolved species to collide with inorganic particles (such as clay) and organic particles (such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoans).</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>These multiple steps cover a wide range of length scales and it is not clear at the onset which processes might be the rate limiting steps. We will develop time scale estimates for several of these steps to help identify which processes will likely require the most attention to design. Many of these transport processes are presumed to occur in parallel. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-transport-length-scales"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 44</span></a> shows the range of length scales.</p>

<dt>Aluminum based coagulants are commonly used in drinking water treatment plants. Less frequently iron based coagulants are used. These metals precipitate in water at neutral pH as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al(OH)_3\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Fe(OH)_3\)</span>. These precipitates form nanoparticles that are sticky. The origin of that stickiness is not well known, but one significant property of both precipitates is that they are both highly polar molecules.

<li>Aluminum (1.61) and Oxygen (3.44) is 1.83</li>
<li>Iron (1.83) and Oxygen (3.44) is 1.61</li>
<li>Hydrogen (2.20) and Oxygen (3.44) is 1.24</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus both aluminum and iron coagulants are more polar than water and it is possibly that it is their strong polarity that enables them to displace water that is bound to particles surfaces and then form bonds with that surface. In order to displace water molecules that are bound to the particles surfaces, the coagulants must have stronger bonds to particles surfaces than the polar water molecules and thus it seems likely that coagulants must be more polar than water.</p>

<span id="heading-ph-effects-of-adding-coagulant"></span><h3>pH Effects of Adding Coagulant<a class="headerlink" href="#ph-effects-of-adding-coagulant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The coagulants used for drinking water treatment are acidic and thus result in a lowering of the pH of the treated water. The optimal pH for aluminum coagulant nanoparticle formation is between pH of 6.5 and 8.5. This is also the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/secondary-drinking-water-standards-guidance-nuisance-chemicals">pH range set by the EPA secondary standards for drinking water</a>. Although many water sources are within this pH range, there are some waters with more extreme values of pH. The aluminum and iron based coagulants are also acidic and in some waters the pH may drop below the ideal range when adding the coagulant. When the pH is outside the acceptable range it is necessary to adjust the pH by adding either a base or an acid.</p>
<p>When aluminum sulfate (alum) to water it dissociates and then precipitates as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al(OH)_3\)</span>. In the process protons, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H^+\)</span> are released and thus the pH (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-log[H^+]\)</span>) decreases.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-rapid-mix-rm-intro-0">

<p>The release of these protons reduces the acid neutralizing capacity, ANC, (also known as alkalinity) of the water. ANC is traditionally measured with units of mg/L of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(CaCO_3\)</span> rather than eq/L.  <a class="reference internal" href="#table-anc-consumed-by-alum"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6</span></a> shows the relationship between ANC measured as mg/L of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(CaCO_3\)</span> and alum (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al_2(SO_4)_3 \cdot 14H_2O\)</span>)</p>

<p>Low ANC waters (See section on <a class="reference internal" href="#heading-buffering-capacity-of-natural-waters"><span class="std std-ref">Buffering Capacity of Natural Waters</span></a>.) could have their ANC increased by addition of a base. A simpler approach is often to use a different coagulant that is less acidic.</p>
<p>Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) is another aluminum based coagulant that performs similarly to alum. PACl is manufactured by slowly titrating an acidic solution containing dissolved aluminum with a base (in the chemical plant) to produce a meta-stable and soluble polymeric aluminum. PACl consumes less alkalinity (ANC) because it is partially neutralized by the titration with a base. In addition, the aluminum mass fraction of PACl is higher than in alum because there are no attached water molecules. The mass of PACl required for flocculation is less than for alum due largely to the higher aluminum fraction. The lower mass of PACl required is an economic benefit when shipping is a significant cost of the coagulant.</p>
<p>There are many different molecular formulas given for PACl. The molecular formulas are either from the perspective of the chemical supplier or represent the composition of the PACl nanoparticles. The molecular formula from the chemical supplier represents the extent of neutralization and hence the replacement of chloride with hydroxide. In that case the PACl molecular formula is:</p>

<p>The extent of the PACl titration with base is defined as basicity. Basicity is the ratio of hydroxyl equivalents to aluminum equivalents. Basicity of 1 would mean that the PACl does not produce any protons when it dissolves in water. Basicity of 0 means it produces 3 protons per Al (like alum). The equation for basicity is:</p>

<p>The lowest basicity commercial PACl formulations are about 10%. Most PACls are in the medium to high basicity range (50-70%). The highest stable basicity (83%) is aluminum chlorohydrate (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Al_2(OH)_5Cl\)</span>) that is useful for treating water with very low ANC.</p>
<p>The ANC of the aluminum coagulant can be obtained from the number of protons it releases:</p>

<p>The molecular formula of the PACl nanoparticles is always some combination of Al, O, and H. One common molecular structure is a Keggin structure with 13 aluminum atoms.

<p>In drinking water treatment plant operation it is sometimes necessary to add a base (or acid) to increase (or decrease) the pH of the raw water. The added coagulant tends to reduce the pH. The carbonate system is most important in understanding how the base will adjust the pH because the reaction between carbonic acid and bicarbonate occurs around pH 6.3, the pK (negative log of the dissociation constant is the pH where that reaction is centered) for that reaction. Carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere is insignificant in drinking water treatment unit processes unless there is an aeration stage. Thus we can use the ANC equation for the case with no <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(CO_2\)</span> exchange with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the section, <a class="reference internal" href="RM_Derivations.html#heading-ph-adjustment"><span class="std std-ref">pH Adjustment</span></a> we evaluate the case where we add a base that will increase the ANC of the raw water and it might also increase the total carbonate concentration.

<p>Rotating propellers can either be installed in open tanks or enclosed in pipes.

<span id="heading-mixing-time"></span><h3>Mixing time<a class="headerlink" href="#mixing-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The time required for mixing in a turbulent environment is a function of the rate that kinetic energy is being dissipated as heat (the energy dissipation rate) and the length scale of the eddies. Given that turbulent energy is passed from large eddies to smaller and smaller eddies, the amount of energy that is being transferred at any given length scale is independent of scale. The result (see equation <a class="reference internal" href="RM_Derivations.html#equation-eq-t-eddy">(186)</a>) is that the time required for mixing is dominated by the time required for the largest eddies to turn over (<a class="reference internal" href="#figure-eddy-turnover-times"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 51</span></a>).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id11">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 51 </span><span class="caption-text">Eddy turnover times as a function of length scale for a range of energy dissipation rates.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The eddy turnover times are longest for the largest eddies and this analysis suggests that it only takes a few seconds for turbulent eddies to mix from the scale of the flow down to the inner viscous length scale.</p>
<p>The large scale mixing time is critical for the design of water treatment plants for the case where the flow is split into multiple treatment trains after coagulant addition. In this case it is critical that the coagulant be mixed equally between all of the treatment trains and thus the mixing times shown in the previous graph represent a minimum time between where the coagulant is added and where the flow is divided into the parallel treatment trains.</p>
<p>It is likely this process of mixing from the scale of the flow down to the inner viscous length scale is commonly referred to as “rapid mix.” Here we showed that this mixing is indeed rapid and is really only a concern in the case where the coagulant injection point is very close to the location where the flow is split into multiple treatment trains.</p>
<p>Fluid deformation dominated by viscous shear and molecular diffusion finish the process of blending the coagulant nanoparticles with the water. We show in <span class="xref std std-ref">Fluid_Deformation_by_Shear</span> that the time required by fluid deformation and molecular diffusion to finish the blending process is approximately equal to 1/G where G is the velocity gradient. Given that velocity gradients in rapid mix units are typically greater than a thousand Hz the time required to finish the blending is approximately 1 ms.</p>
<p>Thus the time required for mixing the coagulant nanoparticles with the fluid typically only requires a few seconds and will be accomplished whether or not the rapid mix unit is turned on. The turbulent eddies from the water flowing a the channel or pipe between the coagulant injection point and the flocculator in most cases will be sufficient to achieve the fluid mixing. However, the step of the <a class="reference internal" href="RM_Theory_and_Future_Work.html#heading-diffusion-and-shear-transport-coagulant-nanoparticles-to-clay"><span class="std std-ref">coagulant nanoparticles attaching to the suspended particles</span></a> may be aided by the high energy of the rapid mix unit.</p>

<p>Coagulant nanoparticles are sticky and can attach to suspended particles as well as to each other. Some dissolved substances also adsorb to coagulant nanoparticles. The development of models to describe these interactions has been impeded by the charge neutralization hypothesis that failed to account for the size of the coagulant nanoparticles and by the complexity of modeling all of these competing processes. Although the model describing removal of dissolved organic matter is still nascent, it is possible that a simplified approach that separates fast and slow processes will enable a sequential model.</p>
<p>Interactions between the various suspended and dissolved substances (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-particle-sizes"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 52</span></a>) can occur simultaneously as soon as the coagulant is blended with the raw water. The rates of these interactions are controlled by the transport processes of fluid deformation and molecular diffusion. Molecular diffusion is fastest for small particles and fluid deformation is most effective for larger particles. Thus the fastest process is hypothesized to be the diffusion of low mass molecules to the coagulant nanoparticles. Transport of the coagulant nanoparticles to attach to suspended solids is expected to be a slower process. Transport of suspended particles to collide with other suspended particles (flocculation) is even slower.</p>

<p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) includes humic substances, fulvic acids, and other organic molecules. The distinction between dissolved and particulate organic matter is somewhat arbitrary and often 450 nm is used as the transition.  The dissolved organic matter could also be referred to as macromolecules or as nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Because of its small size the DOM has a large surface per unit mass. Water that contains high DOM concentrations requires much higher coagulant dosages to achieve effective flocculation. Removal of DOM is a high priority for drinking water treatment plants because DOM both interferes with disinfection processes and produces disinfection by products. A significant fraction of DOM can be removed by coagulant nanoparticles.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>In addition to the general fluids review (<a class="reference internal" href="../Review/Review_Fluid_Mechanics.html#title-review-fluid-mechanics"><span class="std std-ref">Review: Fluid Mechanics</span></a>), there are a few extra fluid dynamics concepts that are important to know in order to understand drinking water treatment and AguaClara’s approach to it. These concepts are primarily focused on the relationships between:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Turbulence</li>
<li>Viscosity</li>
<li>Shear</li>
<li>Velocity Gradients (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>),which serve as a measure of fluid deformation</li>
<li>Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Knowledge of these concepts and how they interact is critical to understand rapid mix, flocculation, filtration, and disinfection. These concepts and their interactions first become relevant in rapid mix, the step in which the coagulant gets added to the raw water.</p>
<p>The two concepts that were not covered in the previous chapter, <a class="reference internal" href="../Review/Review_Fluid_Mechanics.html#title-review-fluid-mechanics"><span class="std std-ref">Review: Fluid Mechanics</span></a>, are velocity gradient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> and energy dissipation rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span>. While these will be very thoroughly described over the course of this introduction, a brief and simple explanation is included to help get the ball rolling.</p>
<div class="section" id="understanding-and">
<h3>Understanding <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-and" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>, or velocity gradient, is a measure of fluid deformation. It is defined by how quickly one point of water along one streamline moves in comparison to another point on another streamline (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_A\)</span> compared to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_B\)</span>, for example), taking into account the distance between the streamlines, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta h\)</span>. A visual example of a velocity gradient is shown in the image below:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id13">
<span id="figure-velocity-gradient-image"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Velocity_gradient_image.jpg"><img alt="Velocity gradient image" src="../_images/Velocity_gradient_image.jpg" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 53 </span><span class="caption-text">Velocity gradients cause relative velocities of fluid elements. Those relative velocities form the basis of particle collisions that are essential for the flocculation process.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note on terminology:</strong> “Fluid deformation” is equivalent to “velocity gradient,” and the two terms can be used interchangeably. They are different ways of thinking about the same concept. Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> is the measure of both terms.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, or energy dissipation rate, is the rate that the kinetic energy of the fluid is being converted to heat. EDR is a very useful concept because the last step of converting kinetic energy into heat is accomplished by viscosity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span>). This kinetic energy being dissipated by viscosity is the energy associated with velocity gradients (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>). Thus, through EDR there is a direct connection between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>. This connection will be further covered later on in this introduction.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, EDR and velocity gradients play an important role in mixing and in causing suspended particles to collide with each other, both of which are important topics in flocculation. Their use is not limited to flocculation, they are also helpful in understanding failure modes of plate settlers and terminal head loss of sand filters</p>
<p>We will begin by defining the concept of energy dissipation rate for a control volume. In a control volume that does not include pumps, turbines or other external energy sources or sinks, the mechanical energy lost is indicated by a change in elevation and quantified as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g h_L\)</span>. That mechanical energy is lost in the time that the fluid is in the control volume, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-rapid-mix-rm-intro-11">
<span class="eqno">(133)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-rapid-mix-rm-intro-11" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\bar\varepsilon \theta = g h_L\]</div>
<p>This equation simply states that the average rate of energy dissipation times the time over which that dissipation occurs is equal to the total lost mechanical energy. The dimensions of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span> are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-rapid-mix-rm-intro-12">
<span class="eqno">(134)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-rapid-mix-rm-intro-12" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\varepsilon = \frac{[m^3]}{[s^3]} = {\rm \frac{W}{kg}}\]</div>
<p>These dimensions can be understood as a velocity squared per time, otherwise known as a rate of kinetic energy loss (recall that kinetic energy is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm Ke} = \frac{\bar v^2}{2g}\)</span>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm Ke} \propto \bar v^2\)</span>), or as power per unit mass, which would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm  \frac{W}{kg}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Velocity gradients are central to flocculation because they cause the deformation of the fluid, and this results in particle collisions. Consider a real-world example via the image below: if everyone on a sidewalk is walking in the same direction at exactly the same velocity, then there will never be any collisions between people (top). If, however, people at one side of the sidewalk stand still and people walk progressively faster as a function of how far they are away from the zero velocity side of the sidewalk, then there will be many collisions between the pedestrians (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pedestrians-on-sidewalk"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 54</span></a>). Indeed, the rate of collisions is proportional to the velocity gradient.</p>

<p>Note that the velocity gradient is independent of viscosity (and hence temperature) for laminar flow. This is because the total amount of fluid deformation is simply based on geometry. The no slip condition, the diameter, and the length of the flow passage set the total fluid deformation. Of course, if temperature decreases and viscosity increases the amount of energy required to push the fluid through the flow passage will increase (head loss is proportional to viscosity for laminar flow).</p>
<p>For turbulent flow and for flow expansions the amount of fluid deformation decreases as the viscosity increases and the total energy required to send the flow through the reactor is almost independent of the viscosity. The “almost” is because for wall shear under turbulent conditions there is a small effect of viscosity that is buried inside the friction factor.</p>
