<p>[I made it about 2/3 of the way through the file and then I ran out of steam. I suggest beginning by stating in text how the design will proceed. Below is my attempt.]</p>
<p>#. Set the spacing between branches to be 0.5 of the sand layer depth
inlet branch orifice size set by maximum diameter than can be used without creating holes through the side of the connection between the branch and the wing pipe.
#. Set the orifice area in the backwash inlet branches based on keeping backwash head loss low. Aim for something between 1 and 5 cm with these numbers chosen to be small relative to the total head loss through an AguaClara plant and assuming that there isn’t any reason to waste energy here.
#. Calculate the spacing between orifices (and make sure it is possible to fabricate)
You can continue with these steps. Make sure that you always know everything required to get to the next step.</p>

<p class="last">Explain the limitation of OStaRS and thus define the range of flows that EStaRS must be able to handle.</p>
</div>
<p>The EStaRS: Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand filter, is a compact filter that can be amended to a 1 L/s floc/sed unit to provide a filter. EStaRS are also used for low flow plants because they are less resource intensive to construct than a small version of the full-size concrete filter, additionally the OStaRS become infeasible in term of maintainence at very low flows because it would very narrow and very deep. This difficutly is noted in OStaRS filters handling less than 8 L/s corresponding to plant flows less than 16 L/s. This challenge invites the EStaRS as an alternative.</p>
<p>Because the EStaRS filter is constructed using only pipes and couplings, the possible EStaRS sizes are discretized as pipes are not available in every conceivable size. This constraint means that there are only three available sizes of EStaRS: 1 ft, 2ft, and 3 ft diameter, which treat .764 L/s, 3.07 L/s, and 7.024 L/s, respectively. Though the design algorithm can account for additional sizes these sizes as well as the 1.5 ft, are the only sizes that have been constructed. The 1.5ft EStaRS was not inlcuded in the list of possible sizes on the recommendation of an AguaClara engineer who helped construct that particular size.</p>
<p>As with the OStaRS, each plant should have at least 2 filters so that one can still be in use even when the other is in backwash. If the plant flow is more than corresponds with 2 filters, additional filters can and should be added in parallel to accommodate additional flow. In additional to requiring multiple filters there are other parts of the design that are the same for both types of filters! The stacked trunk and branch system is the most notable of these similarities, with key differences being in how the inlet and outlet system can be designed. Both the “traditional” concrete entrance/exit channel and boxes can be used, but a more compact design is what is called the “Micky Mouse” filter [link to figure]. This design features entrance and exit tanks made from large diameter pipes rather than concrete making them modular. Most of this design file considers the shared characteristics of the concrete and “Micky Mouse”, but places where the design varies will be noted.</p>
<p>[ How long can the branches be without requiring end support? What is the maximum length of branch that is used in OStaRS? This is a structural issue. A cantilevered pipe must be less than half as long as a pipe that is held at both ends (as is the case in OStaRS). Thus we need structural testing of our inlet and outlet branches before building EStaRS that require stronger branches than are used in the OStaRS. Also a fatigue analysis.]</p>
<p>[Discuss flow control for filters in parallel. A team researched a weir system for this about a year ago.]</p>

<h2>Overall Filter Size<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-filter-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generally 2 or more filters are considered, so that one can still be in use when the other is being backwashed. The number and size of the filters as a function of the design flow rate and the maximum flow a filter of a particular size can handle.</p>
<p>In the design the first step is to determine what size EStaRS is needed because this determines nearly every parameter. <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_figure_body_d_and_n</span></code> shows the process by which the number and size of EStaRS is determined.</p>

</div>
<p>The constraint that defines the filter body size is ultimately the backwash velocity. For the sand used in the filters the required upwards velocity to fluidize the sand is 9.8 mm/s. Using this velocity and the flow area of a pipe, as based on the inner diameter, provides a maximum flow for the filter, based on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Filter} = V_{BW}*A_{Filter}\)</span>. This <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Filter}\)</span> describes the flow that must be seen for backwash to happen properly. Another array is generated by diving <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Plant}\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Filter}\)</span>. This array is equal to the required number of filters (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Filter}\)</span>) of a particulatr diameters to serve a plant with a flow of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Plant}\)</span>. The value that is the smallest number of filters greater than or equal to 2 should is chosen, and the corresponding index of pipe diameter yields the size. If the chosen number is not an integer, it is rounded up to the nearest integer to provide the number of filters to be included. Rounding up guarantees that the entire plant flow can be filtered.</p>

<p>From the determination of the filter body size, the branch and trunk manifolds are the next most important feature of the design. Some relevant variables defined here. These are constrains that are set before actual componenet dimensions are determined.</p>

<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>trunk sizes based on Juan Guzmán’s recommendation in November 2018 to account for fabrication problems</p>
<p>Another important value determined by the filter body size is the area of the filter which is defined as: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ID_{pipe}^2 / 4\)</span>. This becomes important later in determination of the mass of sand needed.</p>
<p>The pipe sizes recommended in this section come from certain assumptions of the amount of head required to use the filter. In November 2018, the difference in elevation of the water level from the exit tank to the entrance tank was increased to 75cm (an additional increase from 60, which was decided a year or so earlier) so that extra head loss in the manifold system does not influence filter functionality as has been seen in the field. This additional head will allow smaller manifold pipes to be used, as the added head loss in smaller pipes (from the increase of velocity) will not overcome the entrance and exit heights. Smaller manifold pipes will mean the entrance and exit tanks can stay narrower, though taller.</p>
<p>The determination of sizes for the drain and overflow come from using the orifice equation and the maximum flow that could be seen in the filter with a 10 cm safety height due the height of the weirs in the entrance and exits boxes in the concrete design and the height of pipe stubs in the Micky Mouse design. The goal with the drain especially is to allow the water to exit at the same flow it is entering in the event that the outflow isn’t working properly.</p>
<p>A schematic of these pipes can be see below in {Make a basic drawing of the filter or an Onshape drawing}. The image is not to scale, but shows generally how pipes are organized within the filter.</p>
<p>[We need an Onshape drawing! Perhaps early next year. The pipes MUST go to the floor. Exit to distribution starts at the bottom of the exit tank. Possibly the top of the exit and entrance tanks are only 10 cm above the filter body. Filter Body has an air vent. Need flow control weir system. Is it possible to have some of the pipes exit through the side of the entrance and exit tanks so those tanks don’t have to be so large? Sand drain? Pipe stubs in entrance and exit tanks for automated switch from filter to backwash. Backwash drain pipe with valve? Considering putting numbers on the inlets and outlets so that you can ]</p>
<p>It is important that the heights between the top of the settled water inlet and the overflow are 10 cm apart because if that distance is too small the overflow may not be large enough to handle excess flow as based on the safety height to find the overflow pipe area.</p>
<p>During operation the height of water in the entrance tank is watched to determine when backwash is necessary as it rises as headloss in the filter increases.</p>
<p>In addition to these numerical constraints there are several other contraints that are more clearly outlined in words.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" id="word-constraints-of-the-filter">
<li>All inlet and outlet pipes must bend and rest on the floor before connecting to the entrance or exit tank to prevent air from getting into the filter body.</li>

<li>The branches on either side of a trunk are composed of one length of pipe meaning the trunk has to be large enough so the branches don’t act like valves.</li>

<h2>Filter Flow Rates and Layer Height<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-flow-rates-and-layer-height" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the maximum flow of the filter is constrained by the available sizes of the pipe for the filter, the design flow of the filter is characterized by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Bw} = V_{Bw}A_{Fi}\)</span>. Filters <strong>should not</strong> be run at flows above those for which they were designed. In the determination of the size of the internal components of a filter the design flow of the filter shold always be used, this ensures that all parts can handle the maximum flow in the filter</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It may seem peculiar that there is no minimum flow in the filter. This is because a filter, during forward filtration, will function fine at lower flows. A minimum flow constraint does occur with backwash, but if the flow is that low that less than one filter is needed it is unlikely that it will need to be backwashed regaualrly enough to be a concern. This issue has not been seen in any plant to date and is not accounted for in the design.</p>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This design will focus on flow through one filter, as having several filters in parallel wouldn’t alter the flow within one, though flow will be split between the filters. To do this a weir system is in place to split flow about evenly during forward filtration.</p>
<p>Within each filter the flow is then further split into the 6 layers of the filter.</p>
<p>The entire area of the filter is assumed to be active and is denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{Fi}\)</span>, as calculated previously as a function of ID.</p>
<p>Within each filter the flow is diverted across six layers. (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{FiLayer} = 6\)</span>)</p>
<p>Thus the flow through each sand layer layer is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiLayer} = \frac{Q_{Fi}}{N_{FiLayer}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is not the flow experienced by all the pipe layers though. As shown in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_figure_numbered_filter_layers</span></code> the two inner inlets, I-2 and I-3 each serve 2 filter layers and as a result carry flows that are double <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiLayer}\)</span></p>

<h2>Sand Layer Thickness and Branch Spacing<a class="headerlink" href="#sand-layer-thickness-and-branch-spacing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the EStaRS filters, of all three sizes (1ft, 2ft, and 3ft), the sand layer thickness will be 20cm for each layer, except for filters designed to go with PF300 plants, then the depth will be 15cm so that all processes can be at the same elevation. In the OStaRS there are functions that define the sand layer depth, but the minimum distance, 20cm is applicable until trunk diameters are larger than 6 inches. Because for EStaRS this variable is unchanging the equations are not included, but it can be found in the OStaRS filter design file in the <a class="reference internal" href="Filtration_Design.html#heading-sand-layer-thickness"><span class="std std-ref">sand layer thickness</span></a> section.</p>
<p>The OStaRS filters have an option to increase the layer depth to account for the added width of the pipes in a larger filter, but in the EStaRS the trunk sizes will never be large enough because the flow is substantially lower.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-0">
<span class="eqno">(569)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-0" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[H_{FiSandLayer} = 20cm\]</div>
<p>This is the center to center distance of the trunks.</p>
<p>As described in the constraints above, the spacing of the branches must be small compared to the layer depth. In this case, small can be taken to be half the distance, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{Spacing) = 0.5}\)</span>. Thus:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-1">
<span class="eqno">(570)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-1" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[S_{Branches} = H_{FiSandLayer}*\Pi_{Spacing} = 10cm\]</div>
<p>This is the center to center distance of the branches and is meant to balance even flow distribution across each layer with ease of fabrication and material use (i.e. having 100 branches would mean very good flow distribution, but would be impossible to fabricate).</p>
<p>Then the number of branches on each side of the trunk is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-2">
<span class="eqno">(571)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-2" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[N_{FiBranchMin} = round(\frac{ID_{FiPipe}}{B_{FiBranchMax}})\]</div>
<p>the ID function also takes the SDR for the pipe (26), but in the equation above was left out so the overall mechanism of the calculation is clearer. The value is rounded because an integer number of branches is needed. The various dimensions of each filter pipe layer can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-manifold-sizing"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 136</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Setting the number of branches allows the flow within each branch to be determined, knowing that the area of the inlet orifices can be determined. It will also allow the sizes of branches and trunks to be determined.</p>
<p>In determining the size of the trunk and branches of the EStaRS the pressure recovery constraints are the most important design considerations. Having a pressure recovery term that is too high will lead to an uneven flow distribution. The two pressure recovery terms that are of particular concern are those in the trunks and branches during forward filtration, and the pressure recovery in the lowest branch during backwash. The first step is to find the flow rate in the branches. Then the PR constraint can be used to find the minimum diameter needed for forward filtration and during backwash.</p>

<p>In the EStaRS there are three components where flow distribution must be considered:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Between slots along outlet manifold branches and between orifices on inlet branches</li>
<li>Between branches along manifold trunks</li>
<li>Between filter layers</li>
</ol>
<p>Having uneven flow distribution is unwanted for several reasons, the mostly importantly being that the goal is for each parcel of water to spend approximately the same amount of time in the filter. If flow isn’t distributed well the distribution of residence times for the parcels will widen which decreases treatment efficiency.</p>
<p>The basis of this part of the design is using head loss in an analogous way as resistors in an electrical system. If head loss is intentionally high at a certain point in the filter, then other differences between paths (such a length of the pipe, or which orifice along a branch is the outlet) will not matter because the head loss of those differences is comparatively small. Additionally, some variation is considered. Creating a system with perfectly identical paths would be extraordinarily complex and would require setting the head loss (and pressure recovery) to zero for paths that have different lengths, so some dissimilarity is allowed for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>These relationships define the head loss constraints of the filter.</p>
<p>The ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{Q}\)</span> has been  somewhat arbitrarily given a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.85\)</span>, meaning the flow exiting the longest path is 85% of the flow exiting from the shortest path.</p>
<p>Thus from above:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - \Pi_{Q}^2 = .278 = \Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the ratio of the pressure recovery in the branches to the head loss through the clean bed (or through just the slots/holes in backwash) is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss} = \frac{PR}{h_{L_{sand}}}\)</span></p>
<p>This equation is used to determine the smallest pipe size that meets the pressure recovery constraint for a certain flow. As the head loss through  the sand is known, the equation can be directly solved for pressure recovery. From the total filter flow the flow throuh any branch can be determined. As the pressure recovery term is directly related to the velocity in the pipe a maximum velocity can be determined from the PR term. This maximum velocity can be used to find the minimum area for the branches from pressure recovery, which can provide a pipe diameter. This value can be compared to the minimum determined by the fabrication constraint of the slotted pipes and the larger of the 2 minimums is used for the design.</p>
<p>Though the piezometric head profiles for the inlet and outlet manifolds for the middle layers may be parallel, meaning the pressure recovery is less constrained for a good flow distribution, a tight constraint is still needed for the outer manifolds where the velocity is 1/2 and the PR is 1/4 (because presseue recovery goes with the square of the velocity) that of the inner layer, while the term is smaller still in the bottom-most manifold where the velocity head is tiny as the diameter is larger to accomdate for full filter flow during backwash.</p>

<p>Using the definition of the pressure recovery ratio, the maximum allowable pressure recovery in the filter manifold can be calculated, this value is not necessarily the actual pressure recovery the system may see, just the allowable maximum:</p>

<p>Subtracting the previously calculated branch PR from this maximum determine how much PR is theoretically left for the trunks. The maximum trunk PR can then be calculated back to a velocity.
[The PR in the branches must be low in order to ensure uniform flow along the length of a branch. The PR in the Trunks must be low to ensure that each branch has the same piezometric head driving flow into (or out of) the filter. Also note that there will be another constraint for the trunk that is designed to get uniform flow distribution between filter layers. And one must consider the flow blockage in the trunk line caused by the branches when calculating the pressure recovery.]</p>

<h3>Second Constraint: Pressure Recovery in lowest trunk during backwash<a class="headerlink" href="#second-constraint-pressure-recovery-in-lowest-trunk-during-backwash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second pressure recovery constraint is in the backwash branch during backwash. During backwash the lowest trunk sees all the flow at a higher velocity than any other trunk does during filtration meaning all of its branches experience a higher flow as well. Because the velocity is higher, the PR term will also be higher, so it must be constrained to maintain even flow.</p>
<p>In backwash there is no head loss through the sand bed because the sand is fully fluidized [not true. there is 1.2 m of head loss through the sand bed.]. The startup time in which it takes to fluidize the bed is ignored in this design. Thus, the only head loss occurs from the flow expansion as water exits the filter manifold out of the exits [Have you described these holes? Need a figure.] orifices.</p>
<p>The initial estimate of head loss through the holes is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiBwOrifices} = 10cm\)</span>. [where did this come from? One proposal is the same constraint as we discussed with the horizontal filter. The head loss through the orifice must be close to the distance between orifices. This is to ensure that the entire bed fluidizes. If there is a section of the filter where the sand isn’t fluidized, then that sand will form an incline that is the angle of repose of sand in water. Thus, the maximum depth that the first covered orifice under the settled sand will be determined by the distance between orifices and the angle of repose of the sand. If we assume conservatively that the angle of repose is 45 degrees, then the depth of sand would equal the spacing between the orifices. And if the head loss through the orifices was equal to that depth of sand, then there would be enough water coming out of the first covered orifice to fluidize the sand above it.</p>
<p>Darn… My analysis in the previous paragraph is flawed because the water flows from the orifices into a big half pipe BEFORE coming into contact with sand. Thus, the head loss through the orifices DOES NOT help ensure that the sand fluidizes everywhere in the filter. Similarly, the orifices don’t have to be sized to get the same flow out of the first and last orifice in a branch because flow equalization will occur in the half pipe. So perhaps the goal is to get reasonable flow distribution between first and last orifice so that the equalization flow has a much lower velocity than the main flow in the branch. We need to figure this out! and this can go near the top of the design. My sense is that there may be a good deal of flexibility in the total orifice area.   ]</p>
<p>[Need to start by calculating the diameter of these orifices and somehow set the spacing between orifices. This requires a design algorithm. Not sure of the steps yet. I understand that the maximum size hole that can be drilled is something close to 1/4” because larger holes end up coming out the side of the gap between the wing pipe and the branch. Once you know the max diameter that can be used for the orifice (Juan should know this) then you can calculate the total maximum orifice area required (based on an algorithm that we need to invent). Then calculate the spacing between the orifices to get the required number of orifices.  ]</p>
<p>Using the head loss ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span> , the allowable PR can be determined: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR_{FiBwManMax} = HL_{FiBwOrifices}*\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>
<p>From above the PR estimate for the Backwash Branches exists.</p>
<p>This allows the maximum velocity in the BW Trunk to be found

<p>If it seems like these processes are 1. similar and 2. circular in their logic, you are correct on both counts! The determination of PR for backwash and forward filtration follows the same steps, the only difference is with the flows and conditions required. It seems circular because the initial calculations are done on guesses, if these guesses weren’t made solving for other quantities couldn’t be done. The step where the trunk calculations are resolved for the branch conditions mainly acts to assess if the initial guesses were reasonable, and corrects the error in the guess, though of course the initial guess could’ve been correct! Running the final values back through the entire process should yield the same results meaning the check was valid.</p>

<p>Regarding the inlets, those for backwash are determined differently than the orifices on the rest of the inlet branches. This section traces the process for the backwash branches and then the rest of the manifold branches.</p>
<p>The spacing of orifices, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_{OrificeEst}\)</span> is estimated at 1cm. [why?]</p>
<p>The number of orifices per branch is the floor value of:</p>

<span class="eqno">(597)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-28" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}N_{BwBranchOrifices} = \frac{L_{FiBwBranchLow} - B_{OrificeEst} - 2*L_{FiBranchExt}}{B_{OrificeEst}}\\and\\N_{BranchOrifices} = \frac{L_{FiBranchLow} - B_{OrificeEst} - 2*L_{FiBranchExt}}{B_{OrificeEst}}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>The only difference between the two is the length of the branches. Because the backwash trunk is slightly larger than the rest of the trunks, the branches must be slightly shorter so that the whole manifold fits in the filter body.</p>
<p>Then for each the total number of orifices necessary for a layer of the manifold can be found by summing the array of number of holes (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{BranchOrifices}\)</span>) and multiplying by 2 to account for the trunks having branches on two sides.</p>
<p>Have the holes close together is important to maintain an even flow distribution, which is why the holes spacing is determined before hole size (which is also constrained by available drill bit sizes) [I don’t think so. holes close together doesn’t help flow distribution because the water flows into the half pipe.]</p>
<p>The drill bit sizes considered are 1/16 inch, 1/8 inch, 3/16 in, and 1/4 inch. The maximum hole size is 1/4in because when the holes are larger they stick out from under the edge of the wings. This is constrained by the curvature of the wings as shown below in <strong>Figure XYZ</strong></p>
<p>The choice of drill bit size is then determined using the cumulative area of orifice needed for a branch.</p>
<p>Generally, the hole diameter is chosen from the closest (but larger) drill bit based on:</p>

<p>The 3 distinct diameters corresponding with these three areas are compared to available drill bits, and actual diameters are chosen.</p>
<p>Because this diameter is likely larger than the calculated diameter, the number of holes must be recalculated for each. The new number of holes is the minimum between the new calculated number (rounded down to the nearest integer) and the original number of holes (which was defined as a maximum).

<p>This number of holes can be used to check that total area of holes is close to the total area necessary to provide the appropriate amount of head loss.</p>

</div>
<p>In this sections the sizes of these tanks are determined.</p>
<p>The size of the entrance and exit tank pipe dimensions is constrained by the sizes and number of the pipes that feed into or out of each tank.</p>
<p>The entrance needs to have space for: 4 inlets, one of which is the bottom, slightly larger pipe for backwash, an inlet from the sedimentation tank, and an overflow pipe, so that if the entrance pipe overflows the water is directed elsewhere rather than just spilling all over the place. The outlet tank pipe requires space for three outlets from the filter, an outlet to the plant exit, and a drain in the event that maintenance needs to be done or if the effluent quality is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The pipes connect lengthwise with the pipe so it is their total area that must fit with the area of the tanks. In addition to the pipe area, they will be connected with ferncos, which add extra space considerations. Additionally, for ease of fabrication the ferncos should not be closer than 1 cm to each other. The pipe sized determined in this section come from using Onshape to determine feasible pipe placements (as there are many configurations that may fit)</p>
<p>The minimum sizes for the trunks and drains specified at the beginning of this file turn out to be sufficient for each design, therefore the entrance tank must accommodate: 4 2” pipes and 1 3” pipes (with the overflow being the only pipe that comes from the side of the tank). These dimensions require a 12in pipe. The exit tank requires 4 2” pipes and 1 3” pipe as well, but the drain is included in that number. Thus a 12” pipe is required for the exit as well.</p>

<p>The active sand depth (the sand actually used during filtration) is just the number of layer times sand depth. This depth is useful to consider how much sand is being used during filtrations. <strong>should this consider the sand around each branch/trunk or does that not matter?</strong></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiSandActive} = N_{Layer}*{H_FiLayerMin}\)</span></p>
<p>The total height of the filter needs to account for the safety distance to prevent sand escape in addition to the necessary space for the sand to fluidize. At the velocity backwash occurs, the ratio of the fluidized bed height to the settled bed height is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{FiFluidized} = 1.3\)</span></p>
<p>It is assumed that all of the sand fluidizes so that:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FluidizedBed} = \Pi_{FiFluidized}*H_{FiSand}\)</span> <strong>make this variable match up</strong></p>
<p>Then, the height of the filter, characterized as a length because it is in the direction of flow is the sum of these components:</p>

<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_Fitting\)</span> is the spacing of the fitting? <strong>But what does this look like? Add a pic</strong></p>
<p>This length comes out to be around 2 meters which is much less than that required for an OStaRS!</p>

<p>One the depth of the fluidized bed is determined, the steady state head loss during backwash can be determined. Knowing this will inform later assumptions about relative head loss in the system.</p>
<p>The following expression is used to find this value:</p>

<h2>Path head loss calculations and flow distribution between layers<a class="headerlink" href="#path-head-loss-calculations-and-flow-distribution-between-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that the sand layer depth is set the Kozeny Head Loss can be determined for the clean bed and the head loss through various flow paths can be determined.</p>
<p>First use the Kozeny equation from <a class="reference internal" href="Filtration_Design.html#heading-headloss-requirements"><span class="std std-ref">Headloss Requirements</span></a> to find the head loss in each of the sand layers. In the design for the OStaRS a different layer height may be used for the bottom layer to account for the larger backwash pipe, but in the EStaRS that difference does not matter, as that additional depth does not contain head loss that matter for the flow.</p>
<p>As the filter has 6 layers there are six possible paths for the water to take. The calculations for head loss through each layer depends specifically on which layer when it comes to minor loss coefficients and lengths of flow paths but the overall process is the same. This section outlines the algorithm without going into the specific calculations necessary for the head loss determination.</p>
<p>In each path, the path head loss is the sum of : inlet plumbing major and minor losses, sand layer losses, and outlet plumbing (for the relevant flow) minor losses</p>
<p>The design steps are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find the max head loss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6) using the equations specified in <a class="reference internal" href="#plumbing-head-loss"><span class="std std-ref">Plumbing Head Loss</span></a></li>
<li>Find the min head loss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6) using the equations specified in <a class="reference internal" href="#plumbing-head-loss"><span class="std std-ref">Plumbing Head Loss</span></a></li>
<li>Find the average head loss of the paths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\frac{sum(HL)}{6})\)</span> (<em>This average is a theoretical term because the flow distribution will change slightly to make the head loss pretty much even in each path (otherwise flow distribution would be a non-issue) It is expected that each layer will have a head loss close to this average</em>)</li>
<li>Find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{layer}\)</span>. The ratio of  the flow distribution. The goal is to be close to 1. This term is calulated as the square root of the ratio of the minimum path head loss to the maximum path head loss. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{layer}\)</span> is a check to ensure all paths provide approximately the same impediment to flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>In figuring out the flow for each layer from the head losses, some assumptions should be made to turn the manifold system into a system of equations.</p>
<p>Because the flow distribution will change to make the head losses even, it can be taken as true that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{Path1} = HL_{Path2}\)</span> and so on for each path, with head loss being a function of the flow. In each path the clean bed head losses are also accounted for, as from the Kozeny equation mentioned previously.</p>
<p>The other necessary constraint is a mass balance:</p>
<p>The flow in all the layers must add up to the flow in the filter. With this information,  a system of equations can be set up to use the head loss and total flow requirement to solve for the flow in each layer. Those flows are then taken as the flow through each layer.</p>
<p>The 6 equations to be solved are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-34">
<span class="eqno">(603)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-34" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4 + Q_5 + Q_6 = Q_{Fi}\\HL_{Path1}(Q_1) = HL_{Path2}(Q_2)\\HL_{Path2}(Q_2) = HL_{Path3}(Q_3)\\HL_{Path3}(Q_3) = HL_{Path4}(Q_4)\\HL_{Path4}(Q_4) = HL_{Path5}(Q_5)\\HL_{Path5}(Q_5) = HL_{Path6}(Q_6)\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Each of the head losses as a function of Q in the latter 5 of the equations to be solved are fairly simple to solve using any kind of solving program (such as Python!)</p>

<h2>Siphon Design and Head Loss<a class="headerlink" href="#siphon-design-and-head-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The siphon in the EStaRS system is different from the OStaRS system because it doesn’t involve air to create suction. It acts simply as an exit for water at the top of the filter. This system only works because the entire filter is enclosed, meaning if the head loss out through the siphon pipe is less than going out the other exits, that is the flow path the water will take. Based on this strict definition of the siphon, this system isn’t really a siphon to maintain parallel naming to the OStaRS, it is called that.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id14">
<span id="figure-siphon-schematic"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/figure_siphon_schematic.png"><img alt="siphon schematic for EStaRS systems" src="../_images/figure_siphon_schematic.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 143 </span><span class="caption-text">This figure shows the important components to the siphon system in an EStaRS system. The component labelled entrance tank either the filter entrance box (for the Micky Mouse design) or the concrete filter entrance box. In either design the head loss calculations are the same.</span></p>
</div>
<p>It works by simply opening the siphon valve as labelled in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-siphon-schematic"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 143</span></a>, then the inlet pipes are closed in the entrance tank with pipe stubs starting at the top, eventually leaving only the backwash pipe open. That’s it! To end backwash, the process is reversed. Inlets are opened back up one at time, and THEN the valve is closed. Though this process is simple it requires some finesse get right. If all the inlet are closed immediately then the water level in the filter entrance tank will drop too low and air will get in the filter. Air in the filter causes head loss problems and is unwanted. To avoid this the pipe stubs to close the inlets are wiggled around to act as valves so that the water level during backwash is around 10cm above the bottom of the filter entrance tank. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-siphon-schematic"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 143</span></a> has this value labelled.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain this height because the height of the water level during backwash as compared to the height of the outlet of the siphon pipe controls the backwash flow. If the water level is too low, the sand may not fluidize. If the water level is too high, the sand may over-fluidize and be washed out of the filter.</p>
<p>The pipe size for the siphon is the same as the backwash trunk: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{Siphon} = ND_{BwTrunk}\)</span>, this diameter is really a minimum to ensure the siphon pipe doesn’t accumulate too much head loss.</p>
<p>The preliminary estimate of siphon length is twice the length of the filter: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SiphonEst} = 2*L_{FilterBody}\)</span>. By making this initial assumption the major losses through this length of the siphon piping can be calculated.</p>
<p>There are assumed to be minor losses in the entrance, exit, and in three elbows.</p>

<p>The maximum head loss for siphon initiation is the sum of head losses of other predetermined quantities including:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{BWinitiation}\)</span> (From head loss section)
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiForwardNoSuckAir}\)</span> (The height the water level needs to be to stop air from getting into the filter.)

<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{BwInletPlumbing}\)</span>

<p>with  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{SiphonNoSuckAir}\)</span> subtracted</p>
<p>These values are calculated or described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#fluidized-bed-headloss-variation"><span class="std std-ref">Fluidized Bed and Head Loss Variation</span></a> section or defined as Expert Inputs for the system. This value represents the highest the water can be over the siphon exit.</p>
<p>To determine a more appropriate siphon head loss the actual head losses are determined.</p>
<p>The head loss of the siphon pipe is determined by major losses resulting from the backwash flow through the pipe. This pipe is labelled in the schematic.</p>
<p>The outlet system head loss is taken as a head loss from a weir using the backwash flow and inner diameter of the siphon pipe.</p>
<p>The orifice head loss of the siphon (where it connects from the filter body into the siphon pipe) is determined using the orifice equation with the inner diameter, the Vena Contracta coefficient, and the backwash flow as inputs.</p>
<p>From those calculated parameters the steady state backwash head loss can be found as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-36">

<p>This the distance in height that must exist between the siphon outlet and 10 cm above the bottom of the filter entrance box, as shown in the schematic. Because the backwash system works using the difference in elevation getting these values correct is critical.</p>

<h2>Sand Volume<a class="headerlink" href="#sand-volume" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Determining the sand volume allows for cost estimation and stability assessments of the filter. As sand is only in the main filter body that is the volume of largest concern. Most generally, the amount of sand needed is the volume of sand that would fit into the filter body to the proper height with the volume of the pipe manifold subtracted, because volume containing pipes should not have sand.</p>
<p>The plumbing within the filter body consists of the Backwash Trunk, the other inlet/outlet trunks, and the branches.</p>
<p>Approximating each of these as cylinders and excluding the small volume taken up by pipe caps, this calculation is very straight forward.</p>
<p>The volume of the backwash trunk is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\pi}{4}*OD_{BWTrunk}^2*ID_{FiPipe}\)</span></p>
<p>The volume of the rest of the trunks is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\pi}{4}*OD_{Trunks}^2*ID_{FiPipe}*6\)</span>
where 6 is the number of trunks excluding the backwash trunk.</p>
<p>The volume occupied by the branches is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD_{Branches}^2 *L_{TotalBranches*7}\)</span></p>
<p>Where 7 is the number of layers of branches, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{TotalBranches}\)</span> the total lengths of the branches for one filter layer.</p>
<p>Thus the total plumbing volume is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{FiPlumbing} = V_{BWTrunk} + V_{Trunks} + V_{Branches}\)</span></p>
<p>Then the total sand volvume in the filter is the volume of the filter (a function of its heigth and area) minus the volume of the plumbing.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{SandTotal} = (A_{Fi}*H_{FiSandLow}) - V_{FiPlumbing}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Multplying the density of the sand, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Rho_{Sand}\)</span> by the volume of the sand gives the mass of the sand, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{Sand}\)</span></p>
<p>The mass of one sand bag, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{SandBag}\)</span> is 50 pounds so the number of sand bags can be determined by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Fi}*\frac{M_{Sand}}{M_{SandBag}}\)</span> (rounded up to a whole number).</p>
<p>As a safety factor, this value is multiplied by 1.25 to get the total number of sand bags:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-38">
<span class="eqno">(607)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-38" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[N_{SandBag} = 1.25(N_{Fi}*\frac{M_{Sand}}{M_{SandBag}})\]</div>
<p>Something this volume of sand indicates, is that the filter is quite heavy and will not tip over! The stability of the empty filter can be determined, but is not necessarily critical to the design because if there is water in the filter there will be some extra pipes stabilizing the system.</p>

<p>The total length of the largest diameter pipe  for the filter body, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{TotalFiPipe}\)</span> is equal to the length of one filter times the number of filters: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{FilterBody}*N_{Fi}\)</span></p>
<p>The total length of pipe for the entrance and exit tanks is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{TotalEntExitPipe} = N_{Fi}*(H_{EntranceTank} + H_{ExitTank})\)</span></p>
<p>The total lengths of the branch manifold piping is the sum of the total manifold piping of one layer times 3, for the three inlets which are all the same size (the slotted pipes are ordered separately because they cannot be hand fabricated at this point). This value is multiplied by 1.5 to account the wings that create the gravity exclusion zone around the inlets, wings are half pipes of the same size!  Thus:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-39">
<span class="eqno">(608)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-39" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[L_{TotalBranchManifold} = 1.5*(3*\Sigma L_{FiManBranch})\]</div>
<p>The lengths of the slotted pipes would be just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3*\Sigma L_{FiManBranch}\)</span>, where (in both) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{FiManBranch}\)</span> is an array of lengths for an entire filter layer</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>note from the writer of this section, at the time of writing is it unclear if the filter manifolds can be constructed with one branch serving both sides of the trunk, this section assumes it can and is being done, so elsewhere in this code the array of branch lengths may just be an array of branches on one side of the trunk! Beware of this as it can cause problems as the lengths will be off by around 2x! If this is resolved in the future all sections will be updated to contain the most correct information</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the number wings to be made is the number or filters times the number of branches (per side) per layer times 4, as there are 4 layers which require wings!</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Wing}\)</span> is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Fi}*2N_{FiBranchLow}*4\)</span>.</p>
