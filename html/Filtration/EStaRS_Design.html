</div>
<p>The EStaRS: Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand filter, is a compact filter that can be amended to a 1 L/s floc/sed unit to provide a filter. EStaRS are also used for low flow plants because they are less resource intensive to construct. Because the filter is constructed using only pipes and couplings, the possible EStaRS sizes are discretized as pipes are not available in every concievable size. This constraint means that there are only three available sizes of EStaRS: 1 ft, 2ft, and 3 ft diameter, which treat .764 L/s, 3.07 L/s, and 7.024 L/s, respectively. Each plant should have at least 2 filters so that one can still be in use even when the other is in backwash. If the plant flow is more than corresponds with 2 filters additional filters can be added in parallel to accomodate addtional flow.</p>
<p>Some parts of the design are the same as for the open StaRS filter! The stacked trunk and branch system is the most notable of these similarities, with key differences being in how the inlet and outlet system can be designed. Both the “traditional” concrete entrance/exit channel and boxes can be used, but more compact is what is called the “Micky Mouse” design. This design features entrance and exit tanks made from large diameter pipes rather than concrete making them smaller and more modular. Most of this design file considers the shared characteristics of the concrete and “Micky Mouse”, but places where the design varies will be noted.</p>

<p class="last">In this file, many values are functions of pipe nominal diameter and SDR. For the simplicity of reading, those values are written with just the geometric value used. For example, if an outer diameter (OD) is needed, it is written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD_{ExamplePipe}\)</span> rather than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD(ND_{ExamplePipe}, SDR26)\)</span> which is more similar to how it would be found explicitlty. Some other features that follow this convention are Inner Diameters and Radii, Outer Radii, and wall thicknesses.</p>

<h2>Dimensions and Pipe Size<a class="headerlink" href="#dimensions-and-pipe-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generally 2 filters are considered, so that one can still be in use when the other is being backwashed. Using more than 2 filters will still work with this design, as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Fi}\)</span>, the number of filters, is changed to accomodate the correct number. This step requires some foresight on how many filters may be needed and of what size.</p>
<p>In the design the first step is to determine what size EStaRS is needed because this determines nearly every parameter.</p>
<p>The filter flow and backwash velocity are used to find an area (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{Q_{Fi}}{V_{Bw}}= A\)</span>), this area is used to find the Nominal Diameter (ND) of the pipe to be used for the filter. the backwash velocity is a function of the fluidization velocity of sand and so is unchanging for every design. If the calcualated area is between values, the larger pipe size is chosen.</p>
<p>From the determination of the filter body size, the branch and trunk manifolds are the next most important feature of the design. Some relevant variables defined here:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BallValve} = 3in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BedTester} = 0.5in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BedTesterOuter} = 1in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiAirRelValve} = 0.5in\)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBwTrunkMinLow} = 3in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBwBranchkMinLow} = 1in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiTrunkMin} = 2in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiDrainExit} = 3in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiOverflowEnt} = 3in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBranchMin} = 1in\)</span></div>
</div>
<p>All of these values are defined as minimum. Another important value determined by the  filter body size is the area of the filter which is defined as: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ID_{pipe}^2 / 4\)</span>. This becomes important later in determination of the mass of sand needed.</p>
<p>The pipe sizes recommended in this section come from certain assumptions of the amount of head required to use the filter. In November 2018, the difference in elevation of the water level from the exit tank to the entrance tank was increased to 75cm (an additional increase from 60, which was decided a year or so earlier) so that extra head loss in the manifold system does not influence filter functionality as has been seen in the field. This additional head will allow smaller manifold pipes to be used, as the added head loss in smaller pipes (from the increase of velocity) will not overcome the entrance and exit heights. Smaller manifold pipes will mean the entrance and exit tanks can stay narrower, though taller.</p>
<p>The determination of sizes for the drain and overflow come from using the orifice equation and the maximum flow that could be seen in the filter with a 10 cm safety height due the height of the weirs in the entrance and exits boxes in the concrete design and the height of pipe stubs in the Micky Mouse design. The goal with the drain especially is to allow the water to exit at the same flow it is entering in the event that the outflow isn’t working properly.</p>
<p>A schematic of these pipes can be see below in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">figure_micky_mouse_pipe_schematic</span></code>. The image is not to scale, but shows generally how pipes are organized within the filter.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This schematic shows the pipe system of the Micky Mouse filter including the drain, overflow, and connections to otehr treatment components</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is important that th heights between the top of the settled water inlet and the overflow are 10 cm apart because if that distance is too small the overflow may not be large enough to handle excess flow as based on the safety height to find the overflow pipe area.</p>
<p>During operation the height of water in the entrance tank is watched to determine when backwash is necessary as it rises as headloss in the filter increases.</p>

<div class="section" id="sand-layer-thickness">
<h2>Sand Layer Thickness<a class="headerlink" href="#sand-layer-thickness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the EStaRS filters, of all three sizes (1ft, 2ft, and 3ft), the sand layer thickness will be 20cm for each layer, except for filters designed to go with 1 L/s plants, then the depth will be 15cm. In the OStaRS there are functions that define the sand layer depth, but the minimum distance, 20cm is applicable until trunk diameters are larger than 6 inches. Because for EStaRS this variable is unchanging the equations are not included, but it can be found in the OStaRS filter design file in the <a class="reference internal" href="Filtration_Design.html#heading-sand-layer-thickness"><span class="std std-ref">sand layer thickness</span></a> section.</p>
<p>So:</p>

<p>In the EStaRS there are three components where flow distribution must be considered:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Between slots along manifold branches</li>
<li>Between branches along manifold trunks</li>
<li>Between filter layers</li>
</ol>
<p>Having uneven flow distribution is unwanted for several reasons, the mostly importantly being that the goal is for each parcel of water to spend approximately the same amount of time in the filter. If flow isn’t distributed well the distribution of residence times for the parcels will widen which decreases treatment efficiency. Additonally, uneven flow distributions will increase the head loss in certain parts of the system which can perpetuate preferential flow paths.</p>
<p>The basis of this part of the design is using head loss in an analogous way as resistors in an electrical system. If head loss is intentionally high at a certain point in the filter, then other differences between paths (such a length of the pipe, or which orifice along a branch is the outlet) will not matter because the head loss of those differences is comparatively small. Additionally, some variation is taken into account. Creating a system with perfectly identical paths would be extraordinarily complex, so some dissimilarity is allowed for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Such that:</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{Sand} =\)</span> the head loss in the sand bed</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR =\)</span> pressure recovery (as defined by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{V^2}{2g}\)</span>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR = H_{LSand}(1- \Pi_Q^2)\)</span></p>
<p>These relationships define the head loss constraints of the filter.</p>
<p>The ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{Q}\)</span> has been  somewhat arbitrarily given a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.85\)</span>, meaning the flow exiting the longest path is 85% of the flow exiting from the shortest path.</p>
<p>Thus from above:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - \Pi_{Q}^2 = .278 = \Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the ratio of the pressure recovery in the branches to the head loss through the clean bed (or through just the slots/holes in backwash) is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss} = \frac{PR}{H_{LSand}}\)</span></p>
<p>Though the piezometric head profiles for the inlet and outlet manifolds for the middle layers may be parallel, meaning the pressure recovery is less constrained for a good flow distribution, a tight constraint is still needed for the outer manifolds where the velocity is 1/2 and the PR is 1/4 (because presseue recovery goes with the square of the velocity) that of the inner layer, while the term is smaller still in the bottom-most manifold where the velocity head is tiny as the diameter is larger.</p>

<p>As the maximum flow of the filter is constrained by the available sizes of the pipe for the filter, the maximum flow of the filter is characterized by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Bw} = V_{Bw}A_{Fi}\)</span></p>
<p>However,the actual maximum of flow that the filter would see is actually the larger flow between that value and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Fi}\)</span> the flow through the filter. For example, if two EStaRS designed for 3.08 L/s each are used for a plant flow of 7 L/s, each filter will actually see 3.5 L/s of flow. This is greater than what the filter was designed for, and this larger flow must be accounted for.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Knowing which flow is being used to calculate the size of certain components is <strong>extremely</strong> important. For calculations involving the pipe manifold the maximum flow that could be seen by the filter should be used (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiMax}\)</span>). This is because the pressure recovery term is the limiting characteristic, and so a greater flow corresponds to a greater velocity which increases PR, which is unideal. For calculations concerning the system of weirs required for backwash, which are calculated in “Backwash Flow Control”,the backwash flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiBw}\)</span> is required because backwash cannot be performed effectively with less flow that the backwash flow. While it is <em>possible</em>  that backwash could be necessary in extremely low flow conditions, it has never been an issue in any plant, so this is not accounted for. Additionally, it is possible that these two values are the same, in which case the distinction is not necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the total flow of the EStaRS and the size of the modules, varying numbers of filters will need to be used, though minimum should always be 2.</p>
<p>This design will focus on flow through one filter, as having several filters in parallel wouldn’t alter the flow within one, though flow will be split between the filters.</p>
<p>The entire area of the filter is assumed to be active and is denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{Fi}\)</span>, as calculated previously as a function of ID.</p>
<p>Within each filter the flow is diverted across six layers. (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{FiLayer} = 6\)</span>)</p>
<p>Thus the flow through each layer is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiLayer} = \frac{Q_{Fi}}{N_{FiLayer}}\)</span></p>
<p>From the area of the filter and the velocity required for backwash, the backwash flow can be determined: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiBw} = V_{FiBw}A_{Fi}\)</span></p>

<h2>Filter Trunk and Branch Diameters<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-trunk-and-branch-diameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In determining the size of the trunk and branches of the EStaRS the pressure recovery constraints are the most important design considerations. Having a pressure recovery term that is too high will lead to and uneven flow distribution. The two pressure recovery terms that are of particular concern are those in the trunks and branches during forward filtration, and the pressure recovery in the lowest branch during backwash. To calculate the estimated pressure recovery term the first thing to find is the velocity in the branches during forward filtration and during backwash. Before calculating this, the geomery of the branches should be determined, specifically the number of branches.</p>
<p>The branch spacing is a function of the size of the EStaRS. The “maximum” spacing is somewhat arbitrarily set 10cm. This value is meant to balance even flow distribution across each layer with ease of fabrication and material use (i.e. having 100 branches would mean very good flow distribution, but would be impossible to fabricate). As a result the expression for number of branches is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_{FiBranchMax} = 10cm\)</span></p>

<p>the ID function also takes the SDR for the pipe (26), but in the equation above was left out so the overall mechanism of the calculation is clearer. The value is rounded because an integer number of branches is needed.</p>

<p>The head loss through the sand layer, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiCleanLayerMin}\)</span> is a fuction of layer depth, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiLayer}\)</span> and overall velocity of the filter , <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{Q_{FiLayer}}{A_{Fi}}\)</span>, using the Kozeny Equation in <a class="reference internal" href="Filtration_Design.html#heading-headloss-requirements"><span class="std std-ref">Headloss Requirement</span></a> in the Filtration Design section.</p>

<h3>Second Constraint: Pressure Recovery in lowest trunk during backwash<a class="headerlink" href="#second-constraint-pressure-recovery-in-lowest-trunk-during-backwash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second pressure recovery constraint is in the backwash branch during backwash. During backwash the lowest trunk sees all the flow at a higher velocity than any branch does during forward filtration. Because the velocity is higher, the PR term will also be higher, so it must be constrainted to maintain even flow.</p>
<p>In backwash there is no head loss through the sand bed because the sand is fully fluidized. The startup time in which it takes to fluidize the bed is ignored in this design. Thus the only head loss occurs from the flow expansion as water exits the fiter manifold out of the exits holes.</p>
<p>The initial estimate of head loss through the holes is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiBwOrifices} = 10cm\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the head loss ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span> , the allowable PR can be determined: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR_{FiBwManMax} = HL_{FiBwOrifices}*\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>

<p>If it seems like these processes are 1. similar and 2. circular in their logic, you are correct on both counts! The determination of PR for backwash and forward filtration follows the same steps, the only difference is with the flows and conditions required. It seems circular because the initial calculations are done on guesses, if these guesses weren’t made solving for other quantities couldn’t be done. The step where the trunk calculations are resolved for the branch conditions mainly acts to assess if the initial guesses were reasonable, and corrects the error in the guess, though of course the initial guess could’ve been correct! Running the final values back through the entire process should yield the same results meaning the check was valid.</p>

<p>Because the flows and area are different for each of the branches the head loss through each system layer is slighly different. This head loss is also only for the one branch system.

The outlet pipes are the only pipes where the porosity of the sand is accounted for because the outlet slot system is the only place in the filter where the sand interfaces with the pipe openings.

The image on the right shows the EStaRS design that is more similar to the design of the OStaRS with a concrete entrance and exit system. Note that these two systems are for different flow rates which is why the image on the right shows two modules.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this sections the sizes of these tanks are determined.</p>
<p>The size of the entrance and exit tank pipe dimensions is constrained by the sizes and number of the pipes that feed into or out of each tank.</p>
<p>The entrance needs to have space for: 4 inlets, one of which is the bottom, slightly larger pipe for backwash, an inlet from the sedimentation tank, and an overflow pipe, so that if the entrance pipe overflows the water is directed elsewhere rather than just spilling all over the place. The outlet tank pipe requires space for three outlets from the filter, an outlet to the plant exit, and a drain in the event that maintenance needs to be done or if the effluent quality is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The pipes connect legnthwise with the pipe so it is their total area that must fit with the area of the tanks. In addition to the pipe area, they will be connected with ferncos, which add extra space considerations. Additionally, for ease of fabrication the ferncos should not be closer than 1 cm to each outher. The pipe sized determined in this sections come from using Onshape to determine feasible pipe placements (as there are many configurations that may fit)</p>
<p>The minimum sizes for the trunks and drains specified at the beginning of this file turn out to be sufficient for each design, therefore the entrance tank must accomodate: 4 2” pipes and 1 3” pipes (with the overflow being the only pipe that comes from the side of the tank). These dimensions require a 12in pipe. The exit tank requires 4 2” pipes and 1 3” pipe as well, but the drain is included in that number. Thus a 12” pipe is required for the exit as well.</p>

<h2>Total Sand Depth, Filter Pipe Length<a class="headerlink" href="#total-sand-depth-filter-pipe-length" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In determining the total sand depth and total length of the filter pipe several distances are assumed:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{BottomCap} = 1 in\)</span> This is the thickness of the cap at the bottom of the filter, without this cap the pipe would be open on the bottom.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{TopCap} = 6 in\)</span> This is the overlap of the cap onto the filter pipe.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FilterValve} = 10 cm\)</span> This is the height of the sand drain. It should not opened unless all the sand is to come out of the filter!</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiBottom} = 5cm + T_{BottomCap}\)</span> This is the elevation at which the sand starts, and exists because the cap has thickness.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FluidizedBedtoSiphon} = 20cm\)</span> This is a saftey distance to prevent sand from ever escaping the filter during filtration or backwash.</div>
</div>
<p>The minimum height of sand in the filter is the depth of each filter layer times the number of filter layers plus the outer radius of the backwash trunk. The outer radius is added because the layer height is defined as the center-to-center distance of the layer, but on the bottom layer there is an additional radius depth of sand, as shown in the following equation.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiSand} = N_{Layer}*H_{FiLayerMin} + OR_{BwTrunk}\)</span> <strong>the actual height should just be calculated here?</strong></p>
<p>The active sand depth (the sand actually used during filtration) is just the number of layer times sand depth. This depth is useful to consider how much sand is being used during filtrations. <strong>should this consider the sand around each branch/trunk or does that not matter?</strong></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiSandActive} = N_{Layer}*{H_FiLayerMin}\)</span></p>
<p>The total height of the filter needs to account for the safety distance to prevernt sand escape in addition to the necessary space for the sand to fluidize. At the velocity backwash occurs, the ratio of the fluidized bed height to the settled bed height is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{FiFluidized} = 1.3\)</span></p>
<p>It is assuemd that all of the sand fluidizes so that:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FluidizedBed} = \Pi_{FiFluidized}*H_{FiSand}\)</span> <strong>make this variable match up</strong></p>
<p>Then, the height of the filter, characterized as a length because it is in the direction of flow is the sum of these components:</p>

<h2>Path head loss calculations and flow distribution between layers<a class="headerlink" href="#path-head-loss-calculations-and-flow-distribution-between-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that the sand layer depth is set the Kozeny Head Loss can be determined for the clean bed and the head loss through various flow paths can be determined.</p>
<p>First use the Kozeny equation from <a class="reference internal" href="Filtration_Design.html#heading-headloss-requirements"><span class="std std-ref">Headloss Requirements</span></a> to find the head loss in each of the sand layers. In the design for the OStaRS a different layer height may be used for the bottom layer to account for the larger backwash pipe, but in the EStaRS that difference does not matter, as that additional depth does not contain head loss that matter for the flow.</p>
<p>As the filter has 6 layers there are six possible paths for the water to take. The calculations for head loss through each layer depends specifcially on which layer when it comes to minor loss coefficients and lengths of flow paths but the overall process is the same. This section outlines the algorithm without going into the specific calculations necessary for the head loss determination.</p>
<p>In each path, the path head loss is the sum of : inlet plumbing major and minor losses, sand layer losses, and outlet plumbing (for the relevant flow) minor losses</p>
<p>The desgin steps are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Find the max head loss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6) using the equations specified in <a class="reference internal" href="#plumbing-head-loss"><span class="std std-ref">Plumbing Head Loss</span></a></li>
<li>Find the min head loss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6) using the equations specified in <a class="reference internal" href="#plumbing-head-loss"><span class="std std-ref">Plumbing Head Loss</span></a></li>
<li>Find the average head loss of the paths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\frac{sum(HL)}{6})\)</span> (<em>This average is a theoretical term because the flow distrubution will change slighly to make the head loss pretty much even in each path (otherwise flow distribution would be a non-issue) It is expected that each layer will have a head loss close to this average</em>)</li>
<li>Find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{layer}\)</span>. The ratio of  the flow distribution. The goal is to be close to 1. This term is calulated as the square root of the ratio of the minimum path head loss to the maximum path head loss. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{layer}\)</span> is a check to ensure all paths provide approiximately the same impediment to flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>In figuring out the flow for each layer from the head losses, some assumptions should be made to turn the manifold system into a system of equations.</p>
<p>Because the flow distribution will change to make the head losses even, it can be taken as true that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{Path1} = HL_{Path2}\)</span> and so on for each path, with head loss being a function of the flow. In each path the clean bed head losses are also accounted for, as from the Kozeny equation mentioned previously.</p>
<p>The other necessary constraint is a mass balance:</p>
<p>The flow in all the layers must add up to the flow in the filter. With this information,  a system of equations can be set up to use the healoss and total flow requirement to solve for the flow in each layer. Those flows are then taken as the flow through each layer.</p>
<p>The 6 equations to be solved are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-33">
<span class="eqno">()<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-33" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4 + Q_5 + Q_6 = Q_{Fi}\\HL_{Path1}(Q_1) = HL_{Path2}(Q_2)\\HL_{Path2}(Q_2) = HL_{Path3}(Q_3)\\HL_{Path3}(Q_3) = HL_{Path4}(Q_4)\\HL_{Path4}(Q_4) = HL_{Path5}(Q_5)\\HL_{Path5}(Q_5) = HL_{Path6}(Q_6)\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Each of the head losses as a function of Q in the latter 5 of the equations to be solved are fairly simple to solve using any kind of solving program (such as Python!)</p>

<h2>Siphon Design and Head Loss<a class="headerlink" href="#siphon-design-and-head-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The siphon in the EStaRS system is different from the OStaRS system because it doesn’t involve air to create suction. It acts simply as an exit for water at the top of the filter. This system only works because the entire filter is enclosed, meaning if the head loss out through the siphon pipe is less than going out the other exits, that is the flow path the water will take. Based on this strict definition of the siphon, this system isn’t really a siphon to maintain parallel naming to the OStaRS, it is called that.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id8">
<span id="figure-siphon-schematic"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/figure_siphon_schematic.png"><img alt="siphon schematic for EStaRS systems" src="../_images/figure_siphon_schematic.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This figure shows the important components to the siphon system in an EStaRS system. The component labelled entrance tank either the filter entrance box (for the Micky Mouse design) or the concrete filter entracnce box. In either design the headloss calculations are the same.</span></p>
</div>
<p>It works by simply opening the siphon valve as labelled in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">figure_siphon_schematic</span></code>, then the inlet pipes are closed in the entrance tank with pipe stubs starting at the top, eventually leaving only the backwash pipe open. That’s it! To end bacwkwash, the process is reversed. Inlets are opened back up one at time, and THEN the valve is closed. Though this process is simple it requires some finesse get right. If all the inlet are closed immediately then the water level in the filter entrance tank will drop too low and air will get in the filter. Air in the filter causes head loss problems and is unwanted. To avoid this the pipe stups to close the inlets are wiggled around to act as valves so that the water level during backwash is around 10cm above the bottom of the filter entrance tank. <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">figure_siphon_schematic</span></code> has this value labelled.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain this height because the height of the water level during backwash as compared to the height of the outlet of the siphon pipe controls the backwash flow. If the water level is too low, the sand may not fluidize. If the water level is too high, the sand may over-fluidize and be washed out of the filter.</p>
<p>The pipe size for the siphon is the same as the backwwash trunk: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{Siphon} = ND_{BwTrunk}\)</span>, this diameter is really a minimum to ensure the siphon pipe doesnt accumulate too much headloss.</p>
<p>The preliminary estimate of siphon length is twice the length of the filter: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SiphonEst} = 2*L_{FilterBody}\)</span>. By making this initial assumption the major losses through this length of the siphon piping can be calculated.</p>
<p>There are assumed to be minor losses in the entrance, exit, and in three elbows.</p>

<p>To determine a more appropriate siphon head loss the actual head losses are determined.</p>
<p>The head loss of the siphon pipe is determined by major losses resulting from the backwash flow through the pipe. This pipe is labelled in the schematic.</p>
<p>The outlet system head loss is taken as a head loss from a weir usong the backwash flow and inner diameter of the siphon pipe.</p>
<p>The orifice head loss of the siphon (where it connects from from the filter body into the siphon pipe) is determined using the orifice equation with the inner diamete, the Vena Contracta coefficient, and the backwash flow as inputs.</p>
<p>From those calcualted paramteres the steady state backwash head loss can be found as follows:</p>

<h2>Sand Volume<a class="headerlink" href="#sand-volume" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Determining the sand volume allows for cost estimation and stability assessments of the filter. As sand is only in the main filter body that is the volume of largest concern. Most genreally, the amount of sand needed is the volume of sand that would fit into the filter body to the proper height with the volume of the pipe manifold subtracted, because volume containing pipes should not have sand.</p>
<p>The plumbing within the filter body consists of the Backwash Trunk, the other inlet/outlet trunks, and the branches.</p>
<p>Approximating each of these as cylinders and excluding the small volume taken up by pipe caps, this calculation is very straight forward.</p>
<p>The volume of the backwash trunk is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\pi}{4}*OD_{BWTrunk}^2*ID_{FiPipe}\)</span></p>
<p>The volume of the rest of the trunks is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\pi}{4}*OD_{Trunks}^2*ID_{FiPipe}*6\)</span>
where 6 is the number of trunks excluding the backwash trunk.</p>
<p>The volume occupied by the branches is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD_{Branches}^2 *L_{TotalBranches*7}\)</span></p>
<p>Where 7 is the number of layers of branches, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{TotalBranches}\)</span> the total lengths of the branches for one filter layer.</p>
<p>Thus the total plumbing volume is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{FiPlumbing} = V_{BWTrunk} + V_{Trunks} + V_{Branches}\)</span></p>
<p>Then the total sand volvume in the filter is the volume of the filter (a function of its heigth and area) minus the volume of the plumbing.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{SandTotal} = (A_{Fi}*H_{FiSandLow}) - V_{FiPlumbing}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Multplying the density of the sand, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Rho_{Sand}\)</span> by the volume of the sand gives the mass of the sand, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{Sand}\)</span></p>
<p>The mass of one sand bag, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{SandBag}\)</span> is 50 pounds so the number of sand bags can be determined by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Fi}*\frac{M_{Sand}}{M_{SandBag}}\)</span> (rounded up to a whole number).</p>
<p>As a safety factor, this value is multiplied by 1.25 to get the total number of sand bags:</p>

<p>Something thiis volume of sand indicates, is that the filter is quite heavy and will not tip over! The stability of the empty filter can be determined, but is not necessarily critical to the design because if there is water in the filter there will be some extra pipes stabilizing the system.</p>

<p>The total length of pipe for the entrance and exit tanks is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{TotalEntExitPipe} = N_{Fi}*(H_{EntranceTank} + H_{ExitTank})\)</span></p>
<p>The total lengths of the branch manifold piping is the sum of the total manifold piping of one layer times 3, for the three inlets which are all the same size (the slotted pipes are ordered separately because they cannot be hand fabricated at this point).
