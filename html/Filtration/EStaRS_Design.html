<span id="title-estars"></span><h1>EStaRS Design<a class="headerlink" href="#estars-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The EStaRS: Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand filter, is a compact filter that can be amended to a 1 L/s floc/sed unit to provide a filter. EStaRS are also used for low flow plants because they are less resource intensive to construct. Because the filter is constructed using only pipes and couplings, the possible EStaRS sizes are discretized as pipes are not available in every concievable size. This constraint means that there are only three available sizes of EStaRS: 1 ft, 2ft, and 3 ft diameter, which treat .764 L/s, 3.07 L/s, and 7.024 L/s. Each plant should have at least 2 filters so that one can still be in use even when the other is in backwash. If the plant flow is more than corresponds with 2 filters additional filters can be added in parallel.</p>
<p>Some parts of the design are the same as for the open StaRS filter! The stacked trunk and branch system is the most notable of these similarities, with key differences being in how the inlet and outlet system can be designed. Both the “traditional” concrete entrance/exit channel and boxes can be used, but more compact is what is called the “Micky Mouse” design. This design features entrance and exit tanks made from large diameter pipes rather than concrete. Most of this design file considers the shared characteristics of the concrete and “Micky Mouse”, but places where the design varies will be noted.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="first admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p class="last">In this file, many values are functions of pipe nominal diameter and SDR. For the simplicity of reading, those values are written with just the geometric value used. For example, if an outer diameter (OD) is needed, it is written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD_{ExamplePipe}\)</span> rather than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(OD(ND_{ExamplePipe}, SDR26)\)</span> which is more similar to how it would be found explicitlty. Some other features that follow this convention are Inner Diameters and Radii, Outer Radii, and wall thicknesses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dimensions-and-pipe-size">
<h2>Dimensions and Pipe Size<a class="headerlink" href="#dimensions-and-pipe-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generally 2 filters are considered, so that one can still be in use when the other is being backwashed. Using more than 2 filters will still work with this design, as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{Fi}\)</span>, the number of filters, is changed to accomodate the correct number. This step requires some foresight on how many filters may be needed and of what size.</p>
<p>In the design the first step is to determine what size EStaRS is needed because this determines nearly every parameter.</p>
<p>The filter flow and backwash velocity are used to find an area (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{Q_{Fi}}{V_{Bw}}= A\)</span>), this area is used to find the Nominal Diameter of the pipe to be used for the filter.  If the value is not one of the options, the next largest pipe size is selected.The backwash velocity is a set paramter based on sand characteristics and yields the smallest pipe that can be used for the filter body.</p>
<p>From the determination of the filter body size the branch and trunk manifolds are the next most important feature of the design. Some relevant variables defined here:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiTrunkMinLow} = 1.5in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBranchMinLow} = 1in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BallValve} = 3in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BedTester} = 0.5in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{BedTesterOuter} = 1in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiAirRelValve} = 0.5in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBwTrunkMinLow} = 2in\)</span></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBwBranchkMinLow} = 1in\)</span></div>
</div>
<p>All of these values are defined as minimums and current field testing by Juan Guzman suggests that these value may be set too small. Specifically, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{FiBwTrunkMinLow} = 2in\)</span> is under scrutiny as of November 2018, and the minimum diameter may become 3 in.</p>
<p>Another important value determined by the  filter body size is the area of the filter which is defined as: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ID_{pipe}^2 / 4\)</span></p>

<div class="section" id="sand-layer-thickness-as-a-function-of-trunk-diameter">
<h2>Sand Layer Thickness as a Function of Trunk Diameter<a class="headerlink" href="#sand-layer-thickness-as-a-function-of-trunk-diameter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>what is this section really used for? Isn’t the sand layer height fixed?</strong> Yes vaguely…but knowing the total mass of sand still matters. It probably doesn’t need to go here. It could go at the bottom I think.</p>
<p>The height of the filter sand layer is taken as 0.2 meters. This distance is the center to center distance. The total amount of sand in the filter is then the number of layers  - 1 times the spacing of the filter trunks added to the outer radius of the bacwash trunk.</p>
<p><strong>In the mathcoad code these functions are NOT used</strong> Can they just be deleted</p>
<p>Two heights are defined here. Both are defined as functions:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiLayerF}\)</span> the height of a standard filter layer. It is defined as the maximum value between the defined layer height, the outer radius (OR) of the trunk  (as a fucntion of nominal diameter) plus the minimum filter trunk spacing  , the outer diameter of the fitting of the trunk (also as function of ND), and the fernco outer diameter (again a fucntion of ND). Each of these is rounded to the nearest 1cm.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiBottomLayerF}\)</span> the height of The bottom filter layer. This is defined as the maxiumum value between 1. The defined layer height, the OR of the trunk + OR of the backwash trunk  (as functions of ND’s of the trunk and BW trunk) + minimum filter trunk spacing, the sum of fitting OR’s for the trunk and BW trunk (function of ND’s), and the average of the ferco OD’s as a function of NDs. Each rounded to the nearest 1cm.</p>

<h2>Flow Distribution Constraints: ratio of pressure recovery to clean bed head loss<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-distribution-constraints-ratio-of-pressure-recovery-to-clean-bed-head-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the EStaRS there are three components where flow distribution must be considered:
1. Between slots along manifold branches
2. Between branches along manifold trunks
3. Between filter layers</p>
<p>Having uneven flow distribution is unwanted for several reasons, the mostly importantly being that the goal is for each parcel of water to spend approximately the same amount of time in the filter. If flow isn’t distributed well the distribution of residence times for the parcels will widen which decreases treatment efficiency. Additonally, uneven flow distributions will increase the head loss in certain parts of the system which can perpetuate preferential flow paths.</p>
<p>The basis of this part of the design is using head loss in an analogous way as resistors in an electrical system. If head loss is intentionally high at a certain point in the filter, then other differences between paths (such a length of the pipe, or which orifice along a branch is the outlet) will not matter because the head loss of those differences is comparatively small. Additionally, some variation is taken into account. Creating a system with perfectly identical paths would be extraordinarily complex, so some dissimilarity is allowed for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h3>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The relative distribution of the flow through a particular path is defined as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-0">
<span class="eqno">(569)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-0" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Pi_Q = \frac{Q_{long}}{Q_{short}} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{p_{Short}}}{C_{p_{Short}}}}\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-1">
<span class="eqno">(570)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-1" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Pi_Q = \frac{Q_{long}}{Q_{short}} = \sqrt{\frac{H_{LSand}-PR}{H_{LSand}}}\]</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Such that:</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_LSand =\)</span> the head loss in the sand bed</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR =\)</span> pressure recovery (as defined by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{V^2}{2g}\)</span>)</div>
</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR = H_{LSand}(1- \Pi_Q^2)\)</span></p>
<p>These relationships define the head loss constraints of the filter.</p>
<p>The ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldQ}\)</span> has been  somewhat arbitrarily given a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.85\)</span>, meaning the flow exiting the longest path is 85% of the flow exiting from the shortest path.</p>
<p>Thus from above:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - \Pi_{ManifoldQ}^2 = .278 = \Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the ratio of the pressure recovery in the branches to the head loss through the clean bed (or through just the slots/holes in backwash) is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss} = \frac{PR}{H_{LSand}}\)</span></p>
<p>Though the piezometric head profiles for the inlet and outlet manifolds for the middle layers may be parallel, meaning the pressure recovery is less constrained for a good flow distribution, a tight constraint is still needed for the outer manifolds where the velocity is 1/2 and the PR is 1/4 that of the inner layer, while smaller still in the bottom-most manifold where the velocity head is tiny as the diameter is larger.</p>

<h2>Filter Flow Rates and Layer Height<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-flow-rates-and-layer-height" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the maximum flow of the filter is constrained by the available sizes of the pipe for the filter, the maximum flow of the filter is characterized by: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Bw} = V_{Bw}A_{Fi}\)</span></p>
<p>However,the actual maximum of flow that the filter would see is actually the larger flow between that value and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Fi}\)</span> the flow through the filter. For example, if two EStaRS designed for 3.08 L/s each are used for a plant flow of 7 L/s, each filter will actually see 3.5 L/s of flow. This is greater than what the filter was designed for, and this larger flow must be accounted for.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Knowing which flow is being used to calculate the size of certain components is <strong>extremely</strong> important. For calculations involving the pipe manifold the maximum flow that could be seen by the filter should be used (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiMax}\)</span>). This is because the pressure recovery term is the limiting characteristic, and so a greater flow corresponds to a greater velocity which increases PR, which is unideal. For calculations concerning the system of weirs required for backwash, which are calculated in “Backwash Control Volume”,the backwash flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiBw}\)</span> is required because backwash cannot be performed effectively with less flow that the backwash flow. While it is <em>possible</em>  that backwash could be necessary in extremely low flow conditions, it has never been an issue in any plant, so this is not accounted for. Additionally, it is possible that these two values are the same, in which case the distinction is not necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the total flow of the EStaRS and the size of the modules, varying numbers of filters will need to be used, though minimum should always be 2.</p>
<p>This design will focus on flow through one filter, as having several filters in parallel wouldn’t alter the flow within one, though flow will be split between the filters.</p>
<p>The entire area of the filter is assumed to be active and is denoted as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{Fi}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Within each filter the flow is diverted across six layers. (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{FiLayer} = 6\)</span>)</p>
<p>Thus the flow through each layer is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiLayer} = \frac{Q_{Fi}}{N_{FiLayer}}\)</span></p>
<p>From the area of the filter and the velocity required for backwash, the backwash flow can be determined: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{FiBw} = V_{FiBw}A_{Fi}\)</span></p>

<h2>Filter Trunk and Branch Diameters<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-trunk-and-branch-diameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In determining the size of the trunk and branches of the EStaRS the pressure recovery constraints are the most important design considerations. Having a pressure recovery term that is too high will lead to and uneven flow distribution. The two pressure recovery terms that are of particular concern are those in the trunks and branches during forward filtration, and the pressure recovery in the lowest branch during backwash. To calculate the estimated pressure recovery term the first thing to find is the velocity in the branches during forward filtration and during backwash.</p>

<dt>The branch spacing is a function of the size of the EStaRS. The “maximum” spacing is somewhat arbitrarily set 10cm. This value is meant to balance even flow distribution across each layer with ease of fabrication and material use. As a result the expression for number of branches is the following:</dt>

<h3>Determining Forward Filtration and Backwash Velocities<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-forward-filtration-and-backwash-velocities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>See Figure XXXX for a schematic of the filter layers.</p>
<img alt="../_images/figure_flow_distribution_estars.PNG" src="../_images/figure_flow_distribution_estars.PNG" />
<p>From the section above it is apparent that the total flow through the filter is the flow through each layer times the number of layers or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Fi} = N_{Layers}*{Q_{FiLayers}\)</span></p>
<p>In the case of 6 filter layers, this is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6Q_{FiLayer}\)</span></p>
<p>Because the 2 inner inlets (the ones that aren’t the backwash trunk or the uppermost trunk) distribute flow to two layers the flow between them is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2Q_{FiLayer}\)</span> which is shown in the schematic. In a later section, we will show that the flow within each layer is not exactly even because of the headloss through various paths, but for the calculation of maximum flow, even flow is an appropriate guess. (<strong>do we know know this</strong>)</p>
<p>From the schematic we can also see that the maximum flow experienced by any trunk is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2Q_{FiLayer}\)</span>, using this value it is possible to calculate the maximum branch through a branch. Using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2Q_{FiLayer}\)</span> is a conservative estimate, most branches will not see this flow, however because the pressure recovery is the main constraint in the filter pipe manifold, it is best to use the maximum possible flow to determine allowable PR.</p>
<p>On each layer trunk, there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{FiBranch}\)</span> branches on <strong>each side</strong> of the trunk. That means the total number of branches on each trunk is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2N_{FiBranch}\)</span></p>
<p>Using the maximum flow in a trunk and the number of branches on a trunk the maximum flow in a branch becomes:</p>

<h3>First Constraint: Pressure Recovery in Trunks during forward filtration<a class="headerlink" href="#first-constraint-pressure-recovery-in-trunks-during-forward-filtration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The total allowable pressure recovery of the filter manifold is controlled by the headloss in each sand layer and the headloss ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span>, as defined above in “Flow Distrbution Constraints”.</p>
<p>The head loss through the sand layer, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiCleanLayerMin}\)</span> is a fuction of layer depth, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiLayer}\)</span> and overall velocity of the filter , <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{Q_{FiLayer}}{A_{Fi}}\)</span>, using the Kozeny Equation (<strong>link Kozeny</strong>).</p>
<p>Using the definition of the pressure recovery ratio, the maximum allowable pressure recovery in the filter manifold can be calculated, this value is not necessarily the actual pressure recovery the system may see, just the allowable maximum:</p>

<p>Subtracting the previously calculated branch PR from this maximum determine how much PR is theoretically left for the trunks. The maximum trunk PR can then be calculated back to a velocity.</p>

<p>The velocity is important because it, along with the known flow rate throug the trunk are used to find a theoretical area for the flow. This area sets and ideal ID for a trunk pipe. Using the pipe database allows a search for the closest match.</p>

<h3>Second Constraint: Pressure Recovery in lowest trunk during backwash<a class="headerlink" href="#second-constraint-pressure-recovery-in-lowest-trunk-during-backwash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second pressure recovery constraint is in the backwash branch during backwash. During backwash the lowest trunk sees all the flow at a higher velocity than any branch does during forward filtration. Because the velocity is higher, the PR term will also be higher, so it must be constrainted to maintain even flow.</p>
<p>In backwash there is no headloss through the sand bed because the sand is fully fluidized. The startup time in which it takes to fluidize the bed is ignored in this design. Thus the only headloss occurs from the flow expansion as water exits the fiter manifold out of the exits holes.</p>
<p>The initial estimate of headloss through the holes is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiBwOrifices} = 10cm\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the headloss ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span> , the allowable PR canbe determined: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(PR_{FiBwManMax} = HL_{FiBwOrifices}*\Pi_{ManifoldHeadLoss}\)</span></p>

<p>If it seems like these processes are 1. similar and 2. circular in their logic, you are correct on both counts! The determination of PR for backwash and forward filtration follows the same steps, the only difference is with the flows and conditions required. It seems circular because the initial calculations are done on guesses, if these guesses weren’t made solving for other quantities couldn’t be done. The step where the trunk calculations are resolved for the branch conditions mainly acts to assess if the initial guesses were reasonable, and corrects the error in the guess, though of course the initial guess could’ve been correct! Running the final values back through the entire process should yield the same results meaning the iteration found a solution.</p>

<p>The only difference between the two is the length of the branches. Because the backwash trunk is slightly larger than the rest of the trunks, the branches must be slightly shorter so that the whole manifold fits in the filter body.</p>
<p>Then for each the total number of orifices necessary for a layer of the manifold can be found by summing the array of number of holes (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{BranchOrifices}\)</span>) and multiplying by 2 to account for the trunks having branches on two sides.</p>
<p>Have the holes close together is important to maintaing an even flow distribution, which is why the holes spacing is determined before hole size (which is also constrained by available drill bit sizes)</p>
<p>The drill bit sizes considered are 1/16 inch, 1/8 inch, 3/16 in  and 1/4 inch. The maximum hole size is 1/4in because when the holes are larger they stick out from under the edge of the wings. This is contstrained by the curvature of the wings as shown below in <strong>Figure XYZ</strong></p>

<p><strong>figure_numbered_filter_layers.PNG</strong></p>
<p>Pipes 2, 4, and 6 (the outlet pipes) are all identical and the total head loss through the outlet system is approximately three times the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{OutletSlotForWard}\)</span> as calculated based on the table above. The outlet pipes are the only pipes where the porosity of hte sand ica accounted for because the outlet slot system is the only place in the filter where the sand interfaces with the pipe openings. The exclusion zones prevents sand at the inlets and as such the porosity is not accounted for in any other head loss calculation. Pipe 7 experiences 2 different head losses depending on whethere the filter is in forward filtration or backwash. Pipes 3 and 5 are also identical.</p>
<p>Additional note for the image above. The pipes show the overall flow direction at each layer. The each of those numbers pipes, from a vertical cross-sections looks generally like the trunk and branches in <strong>Figure XYZ</strong>.</p>

<h2>Total Sand Depth, Filter Pipe Length<a class="headerlink" href="#total-sand-depth-filter-pipe-length" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In determining the total sand depth and total length of the filter pipe several distances are assumed:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{BottomCap} = 1 in\)</span> This is the thickness of the cap at the bottom of the filter, without this cap the pipe would be open on the bottom.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{TopCap} = 6 in\)</span> <strong>This is the overlap of the cap onto the filter pipe</strong></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FilterValve} = 10 cm\)</span> <strong>What is this actually? THe sand drain?</strong></div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiBottom} = 5cm + T_{BottomCap}\)</span> This is the elevation at which the sand starts, and exists because the cap has thickness.</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FluidizedBedtoSiphon} = 20cm\)</span> This is a saftey distance to prevent sand from ever escaping the filter during filtration or backwash.</div>
</div>
<p>The minimum height of sand in the filter is the depth of each filter layer times the number of filter layers plus the outer radius of the backwash trunk. The outer radius is added because the layer height is defined as the center-to-center distance of the layer, but on the bottom layer there is an additional radius depth of sand, as shown in the following equation.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiSandLow} = N_{Layer}*{H_FiLayerMin} + OR_{BwTrunk}\)</span> <strong>the actual height should jsut be calculated here?</strong></p>
<p>This is a m</p>
<p>The active sand depth (the sand actually used during filtration) is just the number of layer times sand depth. This depth is useful to <strong>do something presumably</strong></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FiSandActive} = N_{Layer}*{H_FiLayerMin}\)</span></p>
<p>The total height of the filter needs to account for the safety distance to prevernt sand escape in addition to the necessary space for the sand to fluidize. At the velocity backwash occurs, the ratio of the fluidized bed height to the settled bed height is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{FiFluidized} = 1.3\)</span></p>
<p>It is assuemd that all of the sand fluidizes so that:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{FluidizedBed} = \Pi_{FiFluidized}*H_{FiSand}\)</span> <strong>make this variable match up</strong></p>
<p>Then, the height of the filter, characterized a length because it is in the direction of flow is the sum of these components:</p>

<span class="eqno">(598)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-29" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[L_{FilterBody} = H_{FiBottom} + H_{FluidizedBed} +  H_{FluidizedBedtoSiphon} + OD_{BWTrunkFitting} + S_{Fitting}\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_Fitting\)</span> is the spacing of the fitting? <strong>But what does this look like? Add a pic</strong></p>
<p>This length comes out to be around 2 meters which is much less than that required for an OStaRS!</p>

<h2>Fluidized Bed Head Loss and Variation<a class="headerlink" href="#fluidized-bed-head-loss-and-variation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One the depth of the fluidized bed is determined, the steady state head loss during backwash can be determined. Knowing this will inform later assumptions about realtive headloss in the system.</p>
<p>The following expression is used to find this value:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-filtration-estars-design-30">
<span class="eqno">(599)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-filtration-estars-design-30" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[HL_{BwSS} = \frac{H_{FiSand}*(\rho_{Sand} - \rho_{Water})*(1 - \epsilon_{Sand})}{\rho_{Water}}\]</div>
<p>This head loss value should be very close to the depth of the settled sand bed.  This equation for head loss comes from <strong>…where does it come from….</strong></p>
<p>The head loss of a dirty bed is taken as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{FiDirty} = 0.6m\)</span> As a result the height in the filter for backwash initiation to occur is the sum of headl</p>

<h2>Path head loss calculations and flow distribution between layers<a class="headerlink" href="#path-head-loss-calculations-and-flow-distribution-between-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that the sand layer depth is set the Kozeny Head Loss can be determined for the clean bed and the headloss through various flow paths can be determined.</p>
<p>First use the Kozeny Equation (<strong>ref kozeny</strong> )to find the HL in the central layers and also the bottom layer with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{Layer}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{BottomLayer}\)</span></p>
<p>As the filter has 6 layers there are six possible paths for the water to take.</p>
<p>Overview of the algorithm of this section:</p>
<p>In each path the path headloss is the sum of : inlet plumbing, sand layer, and outlet plumbing (for the relevant flow)</p>
<p>Find the max headloss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6)
Find the min headloss through the respective paths (Q1 - Q6)
Find the average headloss of the paths (sum(HL)/6)
^^a theoretical term because the flow distrubution will sort itself out because that’s how headloss works
Find Pi_layer. The ratio of  the flow distribution. Goal is close to 1.</p>
<p>Because the flow distribution will change to make the headlosses even, it can be taken as true that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(HL_{Path1} = HL_{Path2}\)</span> and so on for each path. This assumes the clean bed headlosses and also accounts for the varying flows in each path.</p>
<p>It is also known that the flow must add up to the flow in the filter. Knowing that a system of equations can be set up to use the healoss and total flow requirement to solve for the flow in each layer. Those flows are then taken as the flow through each layer.</p>

<p>The siphon in the EStaRS system is different from the OStaRS system because it doesn’t involve air to create suction.</p>
<p>The pipe size for the siphon is the same as the backwwash trunk: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ND_{Siphon} = ND_{BwTrunk}\)</span></p>
<p>The preliminary estimate of sipone length is twice the length of the filter: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SiphonEst} = 2*L_{FilterBody}\)</span></p>
