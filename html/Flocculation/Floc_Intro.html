<p>Flocculation transform inorganic (clays such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708010103">kaolinite, smectite, etc. and metallic oxy-hydroxides such as goethite and gibbsite</a>) and organic (viruses, bacteria and protozoa) primary particles into flocs (particle aggregates). Flocculation doesn’t remove any particles from suspension. Instead it causes particle aggregation and then floc blankets, lamellar sedimentation, and sand filtration will be used to separate those flocs from the water. Sedimentation can remove flocs more easily than it can remove primary particles because flocs have a higher terminal sedimentation velocity. Floc blankets and sand filtration rely primarily on capture based on interception and interception is much more efficient when the particles are larger. Thus the purpose of flocculation is to join <strong>all</strong> of the primary particles together into flocs (See movie in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-collisions-in-sequence"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 85</span></a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="flocculation-history">
<h2>Flocculation History<a class="headerlink" href="#flocculation-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Historically flocculation was assumed to involve collisions between all particles in the suspension. The Smoluchowski coagulation equation was published in 1916 and uses a population balance approach to track the number of particles of each size based on the probability of collisions between all possible combinations of particle sizes. The Smoluchowski equation is a statement of the conservation of mass and as such it certainly applies to flocculation in drinking water treatment plants. The challenge is that the probability of collisions between all possible combinations of particle sizes must be somehow known in order to use the model. The complexity of obtaining the collision probabilities and the complexity of solving the equation have preventing use of the Smoluchowski equation for design or operation of flocculators.</p>
<p>For most of the past century there have been two explanations for the particle interactions during flocculation based on the addition of a coagulant. The first explanation was that the positive charge of the coagulant neutralizes the negative charge of naturally occurring particles and thus eliminates the electrostatic repulsion that was preventing aggregation. The second explanation was called sweep flocculation and was the catch all explanation that was used to describe observations that didn’t fit the charge neutralization explanation. Particles were presumed to be swept into a mesh of coagulant precipitate at coagulant dosages that are typically used in drinking water treatment.</p>
<div class="section" id="surface-charge-and-sweep-floc">
<h3>Surface Charge and Sweep Floc<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-charge-and-sweep-floc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mechanism of particle-particle aggregation was thought to be controlled by the average surface charge. Unfortunately no one was able to develop a model of how that mechanism would influence particle attachment efficiency and no predictive models for flocculation were developed. Indeed, there were several observations that were at odds with the charge neutralization hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Flocculation was observed to be efficient even at coagulant dosages that led to positive surface charge. This unexpected result was attributed to “sweep floc”.</li>
<li>Flocculation began to be effective even when the surface charge was still negative.</li>
<li>Flocculation time for highly turbid suspensions was expected to proceed very rapidly and produce very low turbidity settled water. This expectation was not observed and led to the hypothesis that flocs were continually breaking up and producing primary particles or at least very small flocs.</li>
<li>The floc break up hypotheses led to the expectation that high turbidity suspensions would have significantly higher settled water turbidity than low turbidity suspensions. This expectation was also not observed.</li>
<li>The coagulant precipitate self aggregates – this is inconsistent with the positive charge that the electrostatic hypothesis asserts will prevent aggregation</li>
<li>Electrostatic repulsion extends only a few nm from the surface of a particle – and the coagulant nanoparticles are many times larger than the reach of the repulsive electrostatic force. Thus there is no need to neutralize surface charge when using coagulant nanoparticles.</li>
<li>Charge neutralization explanation neglects to fully account for the presence of water in the system. Water molecules will also be attracted to surfaces by London van der Waals forces and thus there will be competition between particle-particle bonds and water-particle bonds. Thus eliminating repulsion is NOT sufficient to produce a bond between the particles. It is also necessary for the particle-particle bonds to be stronger than the water-particle bonds. (see <a class="reference external" href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/30137/Chapter1.pdf?sequence=9">hydration repulsion, page 21</a>) ` “The theory of DLP was a great step forward in that it appeared to circumvent the whole intractable problem of many body forces through its use of measured bulk dielectric response functions. However, it must be stressed again that it is a perturbation theory. That is, it depends on the assumption that an intervening liquid between interacting surfaces has bulk liquid properties up to a molecular distance from the surfaces. This is thermodynamically inconsistent, being equivalent to the statement that surface energies (or alternatively, the positions of the Gibbs dividing surfaces) are changed infinitesimally with distance of separation. This limits the theory to large distances (Young–Laplace vs. Poisson again) where large is undefined.” &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-8686(99)00008-1">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-8686(99)00008-1</a>&gt;`__</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Evidence that the charge neutralization hypothesis doesn’t explain flocculation of surface waters has been accumulating for decades. <em>Sweep</em> flocculation has been proposed as an alternative “mechanism” that described common observations that didn’t fit the charge neutralization hypothesis. However, similar to the charge neutralization hypothesis, the <em>sweep</em> hypothesis didn’t result in the development of predictive equations to describe the process.</p>
<p>For example, in 1992 Ching, Tanaka, and Elimelech published their research on <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90007-8">Dynamics of coagulation of kaolin particles with ferric chloride</a>. They found that the electrophoretic mobility, a measure of the clay particle surface charge, was never neutralized at pH 7.8 and was neutralized at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\mu M\)</span> at pH 6.0. The results were interpreted by the authors to mean that some combination of sweep floc and charge patchiness was responsible for the observed results.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ching-electrophoretic-mobility-vs-ferric-chloride"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 86</span></a> showing that at pH 7.8 the ferric chloride was still negatively charged and yet succeeded in flocculating the suspension to almost the same extent as the ferric chloride at ph 6.0 that was positively charged (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ching-residual-turbidity-vs-ferric-chloride"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 87</span></a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="polymers">
<h2>Polymers<a class="headerlink" href="#polymers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Synthetic polymers often made with repeating units of acrylic acid and its derivatives are used to aid flocculation by bridging between particles. For polymer bridging to occur the polymer chains must be able to span the length scale of double-layer repulsion. The thickness of the diffuse layer is about 10 nm at an ionic strength of 1 mM (Coagulants and Flocculants: Theory &amp; Practice by Yong Kim, 1995). The length of linear polymers ranges from 100 to 1500 nm (<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ma00168a023">Table 3 of Ying and Chu, 1987</a>) and thus both synthetic polymers and coagulant nanoparticles can easily span the length scale of double-layer repulsion.</p>
<p>The shortest synthetic polymers are similar in size to the coagulant nanoparticles and the longest synthetic polymers are similar in length to bacteria. These polymers could create additional connections between primary particles and coagulant nanoparticles or they could connect primary particles. In either case the polymers can add connections (more bonds!) that likely have some elasticity and thus there can be more than 3 bonds connecting two particles.</p>
<p>Polymers undoubtedly increase the connections that bind flocs together and thus enable flocs to grow larger. The stronger flocs created by polymer addition may have unintended consequences in subsequent treatment steps. Large strong flocs are great for improved removal in plate or tube settlers. In sedimentation tanks with floc blankets they may form sludge that is more difficult to suspend after a brief shutdown. In filters it is possible that large flocs are more rigid and fail to enter the pore spaces of the filter. Thus the use of polymers may require using large media size for depth filtration. The polymers may also form mudballs in granular filters and thus require more aggressive washing.</p>

<h2>AguaClara Hydraulic Flocculation Model<a class="headerlink" href="#aguaclara-hydraulic-flocculation-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The AguaClara hydraulic flocculation model was developed over 15 years of extensive laboratory and field research and is based on the physics of interactions between particles in the raw water, dissolved organic molecules, and coagulant nanoparticles in a shear flow. The AguaClara model is based on the physics of these interactions and is the first non-empirical flocculation model. The AguaClara Hydraulic Flocculation model is described in detail in <a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Model.html#title-flocculation-model"><span class="std std-ref">Flocculation Model</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="collisions-in-shear-flow">
<h3>Collisions in Shear Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#collisions-in-shear-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that hydraulic flocculators approach plug flow conditions it is reasonable to assume that at any given location in the flocculator there is a predominance of one size of flocs. Thus collisions between similar sized flocs are most likely because that is what is present. There is also a hydrodynamic reason why collisions between similar sized flocs are favored.</p>
<p>In a shear flow the particles rotate and a boundary layer is created all around the rotating particles. The boundary layer prevents collisions between different sized particles (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-no-dissimilar-collisions-in-shear"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 88</span></a>) because the smaller of the two particles is unable to extend through the boundary layer of the larger particle. Only particles that are large enough to extend through each other’s boundary layers can collide (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-similar-size-collisions-in-shear"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 89</span></a>). Thus the particles must be similar in size because the boundary layer also scales with the diameter of the particle.</p>

<p>The rotating boundary layers in a shear flow limit collisions to similar sized particles. Given that flocculation is an environment specifically designed to create fluid shear it is reasonable to assume that only collisions between similar sized particles are able to occur. This simplifies the Smoluchowski equation tremendously.</p>

<h2>Flocs are Fractals<a class="headerlink" href="#flocs-are-fractals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As flocs combine they don’t coalesce like mist turning into rain drops. Instead they form loose aggregates that contain a higher and higher fraction of water in the voids between the solid primary particles.</p>
<p>Although the obvious flocculation advantage is that it produces larger aggregates that are easier to remove, it is also <strong>possible</strong> (this is a hypothesis that needs testing) that a difference in a physical property between primary particles and flocs plays a role in enhanced removal of flocs in floc blankets and filters. For example, the many relatively weak connection points between the primary particles in the flocs enables the flocs to deform. It is possible that deformation plays an important role right at the moment of collision. Presumably the bond strength required to lock the colliding particles together is less if the particles can deform as they are colliding.</p>
<p>The size change produced by flocculation is dramatic. Clay particles and pathogens have sizes that are order <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> and they combine to form flocs that are order <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(mm\)</span>. A thousand fold increase in diameter suggests a billion fold increase in volume.</p>

<p>One of the mysteries of flocculation has been why it is such a slow process, requiring 30 minutes according to conventional design, and yet it appears to be a very rapid process. Plant operators observe that with high raw water turbidities that they can see flocculation progressing after about 0.5 minutes of flocculation.

Given that flocculation is visible at this low collision potential, it is unclear why recommended <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> are as high as 100,000.

<h2>AguaClara Flocculation History<a class="headerlink" href="#aguaclara-flocculation-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>2005 - We used conventional guidelines based on velocity gradient to design the first low flow vertical flocculator</p>
<p>2010 - We designed using energy dissipation rate and accounted for the nonuniformity of the energy dissipation rate (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> = 15 minutes)</p>
<p>2015 – We added obstacles to decrease the distance between expansions to make all of our flocculators have maximum collision efficiency (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> = 8 minutes)</p>
<p>2016 – Learned that particle/floc collisions are dominated by viscous shear (not by turbulent eddies). Began designing flocculators based on a target head loss of 40 cm. Used a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> of 37,000.</p>
<p>2017 - Designed a pipe flocculator for the 1 L/s plant with a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> of 20,000 and a residence time of about 100 s.</p>
