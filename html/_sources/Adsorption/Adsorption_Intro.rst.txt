Adsorption Introduction
**************************


Removal of a dissolved contaminant by adsorption is one of our best available options for removing many dissolved contaminants.

Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)
===============================

GAC can be placed in a column and designed as a porous media filtration system. The removal mechanism, adsorption, is very different from filtration of flocs and there is no need to backwash the bed of GAC since it is removed dissolved species rather than suspended solids. GAC columns can be configured with 2 or more columns in series so that a first column in the series can be fully loaded with the contaminant before taking it off line for replacement of the GAC. The new GAC column is then plumbed so that it is the last column in the series.

Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)
===============================
