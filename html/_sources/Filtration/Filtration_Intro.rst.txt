Filtration  Introduction
************************

"If the water is dirty, then filter it". That is a common misunderstanding of what we should do if the water is dirty. And that misunderstanding has led to many, many failures of water treatment technologies. There are slow sand filters and multistage filters abandoned in many corners of Honduras. The first AguaClara plant at Marcala, Honduras was built in an abandoned filtration plant. In many cases the failed filters were installed in locations where the raw water carried far too much sediment to be treated by filtration. This common misunderstanding of the capabilities of sand filters has a long history.

History of Filtration
======================

Starting in 1829 surface water treatment plants in England used slow sand filters. Decades later in 1885 they discovered that slow sand filters actually remove bacteria. That was quite a surprise given that the pores in slow sand filters are perhaps 50 times larger than the bacteria that they remove! Clearly filters were doing something more interesting than simply straining out particles that were bigger than the pores.

Slow sand filtration ran into big trouble when they were installed in cities along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the United States. The high sediment load carried by those rivers could not be removed using slow sand filters. The need to treat water with high sediment loads (high turbidities) led to the innovation of coupling flocculation, sedimentation, and a new kind of filter - rapid sand filters. The early emphasis on filtration as the primary process persisted and continues even today. For example, the surface water treatment plant that provides drinking water to the Cornell University campus is called Cornell Water Filtration Plant.

The process that removes most of the particles in the Cornell Water Filtration Plant is the sedimentation tank with big assistance from the flocculators. The rapid sand filters are a polishing step that removes approximately 1 NTU or about 1 mg/L of solids. This is not to diminish the importance of filtration. After all, this chapter is all about filtration. The goal is to put filtration in context and remind all of us that both slow and rapid sand filters are limited to polishing water that is already very clean.

Slow Sand Filters
-----------------

Slow sand filters don't use coagulants or pretreatment. They are suited for surface waters coming from pristine watersheds. They are a passive technology in that there is no way for an operator to improve performance other than to clean the filter.

Slow sand filters are sometimes called bio filters, a misunderstanding that has persisted from the early observations that biofilms grow (or are imported) in the sand bed. Although biofilms do form in slow sand filters it is unlikely that they play a role in particle removal. Weber-Shirk demonstrated that removal of E. coli by slow sand filters was insignificant even when the filters had 1 m of head loss due to biofilm growth. Weber-Shirk also demonstrated that slow sand filters perform well even when poisoned with azide. Weber-Shirk also demonstrated that predation by a small protozoan, a chrysophyte, can play a role in the removal of bacteria. The chrysophyte is too small to ingest protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium or Giardia lamblia and thus those organisms are likely only removed by physical-chemical means. Similarly it is unlikely that the chrysophyte wastes energy on ingesting virus particles. The dominant particle removal mechanism in slow sand filters is physical-chemical and is the same mechanisms at work in rapid sand filters. Naturally occurring aluminum creates sticky surfaces in the sand bed and makes some of the influent particles sticky. It is likely that aluminum content in the raw water plays a significant role in slow sand filter performance. The aluminum hydroxide nanoparticle "glue" is likely able to effect the removal of a wide range of particle sizes.

Slow sand filters remove the majority of the particles in the top cm of the sand bed. A schmutzdecke (filter cake or layer of dirt) generally forms on top of the sand and this layer of dirt causes the majority of the head loss thru the filter bed. It is this thin layer that is removed when the head loss is too high to achieve the desired flow rate through the filter. Most slow sand filters are cleaned by hand using shovels to remove a thin layer of the schmutzdecke. The cleaning process is labor intensive and requires taking the filter offline for a day or longer.

    Slow sand filters at Jesus de Otoro, Honduras. Slow sand filters require extensive areas of flat terrain or extensive earthwork to create a level spot. In the tropics the filters are open to the sky and that results in nuisance growth of algae. In climates where freezing is a problem the filters are covered.

Multistage filters
------------------

Multistage filters were invented to extend the range of applicability of slow sand filters. Slow sand filters were viewed as an appropriate technology for rural communities, but their very limited ability to treat water with suspended solids made them inappropriate for communities that have surface water sources with high turbidity during runoff events. Roughing filters made with various sizes of gravel were added to remove sediment. The roughing filters were essentially inefficient sedimentation tanks with 60% of their volume occupied by rocks! Roughing filters were also difficult to clean and without using coagulants their particle removal efficiency was poor. Nonetheless, multistage filters have been built in many rural communities in Latin America.

Rapid Sand Filters
------------------

It is always interesting to try to understand why different technologies were invented and specifically what problem they were trying to solve. One possibility is that goal was to reduce the labor required for cleaning slow sand filters by devising a system to clean the sand in place. Given the idea of fluidizing the bed of sand with a high upflow velocity it then became tempting evolve to higher flow rates during filtration because having to clean the filter frequently was no longer a problem. Another possibility is that rapid sand filters were invented to handle higher turbidity water, but that isn't supported by the capabilities of rapid sand filters. Slow and rapid sand filters have very similar maximum influent water turbidity limits. Thus the real advantage to rapid sand filters is that they can be cleaned quickly.

Many rapid sand filters use 2 or 3 different densities and sizes of filter media to achieve a system with large pores at the surface of the filter and smaller pores deeper within the filter. If sand with a wide range of sizes is fluidized the small sand grains quickly rise to the top and the large sand grains fall to the bottom. Thus a poorly sieved sand will have small pores at the top and large pores at the bottom after backwash. The trick to creating a mix of filter media that results in big pores on the top is to use low density, large diameter media with a lower terminal velocity than a higher density, small diameter media. During backwash the less dense media ends up on top and thus this reverse stratification is achieved.

Given that many installed rapid sand filters are dual media it is worth reflecting on what problem the dual media filters are designed to solve. One possible problem is surface clogging of the sand filter when large, strong flocs bridge across sand pores and then support a layer of flocs above the sand bed. This surface layer would be similar to the schmutzdecke in slow sand filters and could be the location of significant head loss. It appears that rapid sand filters do suffer from surface clogging in some instances. Of course, it is possible that this failure is related to the use of flocculent aids that result in excessively strong flocs and/or sedimentation tanks that don't effectively capture large flocs.

Additional potential benefits of dual media filtration include the possibility that they can hold a larger mass of particles before requiring backwash or that they may be able to achieve higher particle removal efficiency. `Zouboulis et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2006.02.102>`_ compared single and dual media filtration and demonstrated that the main advantage to dual media filtration was that it had a lower rate of head loss accumulation. Given that the rate of increase of head loss for the dual media filters was constant over time suggests that the pores that were doing the filtration were exclusively in the larger of the two media. This suggests that larger diameter media (rather than dual media) might be a better choice for rapid sand filters.

Dual media filters face more challenges during cleaning. The use of relatively low density media for the top layer results in a lower density fluidized bed. This lower density fluidized bed makes it possible for flocs to form mudballs that are sufficiently dense to fall through the top layer of media during backwash (page 221 of Water and Wastewater Technology, 6th edition, by Hammer and Hammer, 2008). The formation of these mudballs is one of the reasons that dual media filters use air scour before or during backwash to breakup the mudballs.

The addition of flocculation and sedimentation prior to filtration changes the properties of the incoming particles. The settled water contains small flocs and primary particles with some coagulant nanoparticles attached. These particles are sticky and the stickiness undoubtedly influences the physics of the particle attachment processes inside the sand bed. We will talk more about the mysteries of life inside a filter bed later in this chapter.

Rapid sand filters rely on a backwash system.  It takes a relatively high velocity of water to fluidize a bed of sand and that water has to come from somewhere. In conventional water treatment plants that water comes from a clearwell that is filled with filtered water. During backwash water from the clearwell is pumped through the filter and then either wasted or returned to the head of the plant for another pass through the treatment processes. The need for pumps is one of the big disadvantages of conventional rapid sand filters. Conventional rapid sand filters fail if they lose power or if there isn't enough filtered water in the clearwell when the filter needs to be backwashed. This raises an interesting question about how rapid sand filters are initially commissioned at water treatment plants given that the clearwell is initially empty and given that filters MUST BE FILLED WITH WATER FROM THE BOTTOM. If you dump water on top of a dry filter bed the water will create a few paths down through the sand and the majority of the sand pores will remain filled with air even when the level of water floods the top of the filter bed. Thus the first operation in rapid sand filter startup must be backwash!

One solution for eliminating the need for backwash pumps is to design a set of filters that work together to backwash one of the filters. This eliminates the need for a clearwell for backwash water. This system of a set of filters is used by `CEPIS <http://cepis.org.pe/sobre-el-cepis/>`_ in their design of `rapid sand filters <../_static/references/CEPIS/CEPIS5_Batería_de_filtros.pdf>`_ This system is an elegant solution that works well for small cities, but the requirement of 6 filters is onerous for towns where 2 filters should have been sufficient.

.. _figure_CEPIS_filter_set:

    :alt: filter set

    6 filters form a complete set such that 5 filters can work together to backwash one filter without using pumps.


Stacked Rapid Sand Filters
--------------------------

Stacked Rapid Sand, StaRS, filters were invented in 2010 by the AguaClara Cornell program in response to the need for a new technology that would both eliminate the need for backwash pumps AND not require the construction of 6 filters for small towns. StaRS filters use 6 20 cm deep layers of sand (no dual media here) with the layers stacked vertically. The six layers give a total sand depth of 1.2 m. The filter operates with the same design flow rate for both backwash and filtration modes and uses settled water for backwash. This eliminates the startup problem for rapid sand filters that don't have an initial source of backwash water. The shallow filter layers take advantage of new insights into the filtration mechanisms (more on that soon).

StaRS filters come in two configurations. Open StaRS (OStaRS) are used for flow rates greater than about 8 L/s. An 8 L/s filter has a plan view area of 85 cm x 85 cm. This is considered the minimum size that can be constructed with a human working inside the filter. For lower flow rates Enclosed StaRS (EStaRS) filters can be assembled using PVC pipe as the body of the filter. The inner plumbing can be accessed through openings in the top and bottom of the main filter body.

The slowest (and hence largest) unit process in the AguaClara surface water treatment train is sedimentation. Thus sedimentation represents the most likely opportunity for significant cost reduction. The entire AguaClara treatment train is a fraction of the size of the dynamic filters that are used in multiple stage filtration plants.

Filters remove the least amount of contaminants in a surface water treatment plant.

Filters have a huge range in velocities that correspond to a huge range in size. This is illustrated in the city of Jesus de Otoro, Honduras. They have both a 20 L/s multiple stage filtration plant and a 20 L/s AguaClara plant serving different sections of the city. The plants can both be seen in `Google Maps <https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1Rjl2cfjMn0Pk7E11KVq9A1mlj2Q&ll=14.491993514824715%2C-87.97505904373156&z=16>`_.

    Two water treatment plants using different technologies and serving the same city illustrate the high construction cost of low technologies simply based on the required size of the low tech facilities.

Filtration Theory
=================

Filters are used to remove particles and thus we'd like to be able to predict particle removal efficiency in a filter. Unfortunately we don't yet have equations that describe particle removal by sand filtration. This is a very unpleasant surprise. It is as if we were designing a suspension bridge and didn't have any equations describing the relationship between the tension in the cables and the load they are supporting.

Reflection: How did we get to 2018 without a model for filter performance? There may be several reasons for the lack of a filtration model. Here are a few ideas.
 - The lack of data acquisition systems in university laboratories means that very few rapid sand filters were operated and evaluated for full filter runs in laboratory settings
 - The Environmental Engineering fixation on jar tests as the way to model water treatment plants provided no method to test filtration and thus most university laboratories only experimented with batch operation and not continuous flow.
 - Filtration models were borrowed from air filtration (`Yao et al, 1971 <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es60058a005>`_) and thus did not take into account that the coagulant nanoparticles made particle attachment to surfaces very favorable.
 - Filtration models only modeled the clean bed phase(the first few minutes of a filter run) before particles were deposited and began altering the geometry of the pores.

It is quite amazing that we have no useful models for sand filter performance after more than a century of using sand filters as a required process in converting surface waters into safe drinking water. Fortunately we have plenty of clues suggesting what is happening inside filters and at the level of the particles traveling through the pores.

The movie in :numref:`figure_Active_zone_model` illustrates that the classic performance of a rapid sand filter as a function of time could be explained by the presence of an active filtration zone that slowly progresses down through the filter as the pores become fully loaded. But that begs the question of what determines "fully loaded."

   Movie illustrating how effluent turbidity connects to deposition of particles within a sand bed.

The linear increase in head loss with time (see :refnum:`figure_Head_loss_vs_time`) is a remarkable and surprising property of depth filtration. The deposition of particles in a pore would change the flow geometry, increase the flow velocity, and increase the head loss across the pore. As each particle is deposited in the pore it would be expected to have an increasing impact on head loss as the flow area is decreased and the flow velocity increases.  Head loss due to the flow expansion downstream from the flow constriction is proportional to the velocity squared. Thus we would not expect head loss across a pore to increase linearly with time.


.. _figure_Head_loss_vs_time:

.. figure:: Images/Head_loss_vs_time.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center
   :alt: Head loss increases linearly with time

   Head loss through a filter increases linearly with time under conditions of constant influent turbidity.

The data is trying to tell us something. The head loss through a filter does increase linearly with time and with the amount of solids that have been captured by the filter. Our hypothesis is that the number of fully loaded pores is increasing linearly with time. To understand how this might be working we need to delve into the filter and imagine what must be happening in the pores as particles are flowing by.

:refnum:`figure_Deposition_at_constrictions` illustrates that particles that are carried by the fluid can come into contact with the walls of the pores where the streamlines converge. Clean bed filtration models predict that this process of interception is significant even for clean beds. As a pore begins to fill due to particle deposition, the flow constriction becomes even more severe and thus the capture efficiency increases. This would suggest that a pore would rapidly fill with flocs until it became so clogged that the flow of water through the pore effectively stopped.

   Movie illustrating that particles are transported closer to sand surfaces where streamlines converge.

If pores clogged completely, then sand filters would clog as soon as one layer of pores was filled. There must be another process that is preventing pores from clogging. We hypothesize that flocs can't attach to the filter surfaces when the fluid drag on the floc exceeds the strength of the bonds between the coagulant nanoparticles and the particle and pore surfaces. Thus as pores grow smaller due to deposition it becomes more difficult for incoming flocs to attach. Instead, the flocs are shoved right through the pore even if it means the floc has to undergo significant deformation to squeeze through.

   Movie showing flocs flowing through a pore created by sand grains. (Credit `Filter_Constrictions team Spring 2018 <https://github.com/AguaClara/filter-constrictions>`_)

The story is beginning to emerge. Converging streamlines result in flocs touching previously deposited particles in the flow constriction and attaching. As the flow constriction becomes even smaller the fluid drag on particles that attempt to attach to the pore becomes too great and the particles are forced through the constriction. At that point the pore is fully loaded. However, fully loaded does not mean that the void is full of flocs. It just means that the constriction is as small as it can get given the strength of the coagulant nanoparticle bonds and the fluid drag on the flocs.

Pores at the upstream end of the filter are fully loaded first and then remain relatively unchanged for the duration of the filter run. Thus the active filtration zone is pushed deeper into the filter bed. At any one time there are likely a series of pores that are partially loaded and thus actively filling. The number of pores in series that are actively filling is not yet known, but it is clear that the particle removal efficiency of a filter must be related to the number of actively filling pores in series.

The active filtration zone is progressing through the filter at a constant velocity. The number of fully loaded pores is increasing linearly with time! That is why head loss increases linearly with time.

The poor performance at the beginning of a filter run is because the clean zone isn't a good filter. This suggests that dual media filters are pointless because the smaller media at the downstream end of the filter remains clean and doesn't actually do anything. If this is correct, then multimedia filters can be replaced with a single larger media size.

As coagulant dose increases
 - flocs are larger and thus they fill the pores faster and thus the active zone moves faster through the filter
 - large flocs are removed more efficiently and thus the active zone is thinner (fewer active pores in series)
 - thinner active zone results in faster failure (higher slope of turbidity vs time during failure)
 - larger flocs results in faster failure (higher slope of turbidity vs time during failure)

As sand size increases
 - There are fewer pores and thus fewer constrictions and thus less head loss at the end of the filter run
 - Each constriction requires more particles to build and thus there is less head loss per mass of particles removed.

What about particle removal efficiency?
---------------------------------------

This is the multi-decade old question that challenges us to continue our research. What determines how many particles sneak through a water treatment plant? We've learned that flocculation runs out of steam because the primary particles only want to collide with other primary particles and thus they start taking forever to collide as they become scarce. The floc blanket likely acts like a series of collectors (can't say it is like a filter because it doesn't have stationary constrictions). This would suggest that more floc blanket is always better. For some reason some primary particles make it through the floc blanket. What determines how many of those primary particles make it through the filter? It must depend on the geometry of every constriction. That is so complicated. Is there another way to think about this? Large flocs are easy to capture in a sand filter. Primary particles are much more difficult to capture. Large flocs tend to fill up the first unfilled pore they come to. Thus large flocs tend to take active pores out of service. This suggests that the influent floc size distribution might influence filter performance.

Primary particles have the lowest probability of hitting the wall in a constriction. Thus primary particles can travel the greatest distance through the active zone and still have a very small chance of being deposited near the end of the active zone. Thus it is possible that primary particles set the maximum length of the active zone and flocs tend to fill in the active zone at the upstream end. The larger the floc the more likely it will fill in an upstream constriction and thus shorten the active zone.

This suggests that one way to improve filter performance is to have a zone of very high shear that rips flocs apart so that they don't fill in the upstream pores in the active zone so quickly. This is because smaller flocs will not be removed as efficiently by each constriction and thus they will penetrate deeper into the active zone. One possible method to create a high shear zone is to size the flow injection area to achieve high shear through the first sand grains. The idea is to shred incoming flocs so they have a lower probability of being removed per pore and thus more of these small flocs penetrate deeper into the active filtration zone before being captured. Smaller flocs are also more dense and thus don't fill up the available volume in the constrictions as fast as the large flocs that they came from.

We need an estimate of the shear through the first pores as the water enters the sand. The Kozeny equation is valid up to a particle Reynolds number of 1 (:eq:`eq_Re_porous_media`). The Reynolds number at this proposed flow injection site will be much larger than 1 and thus the Erdun equation (:eq:`eq_Erdun`) that is valid for laminar and turbulent flow in porous media will be used.

We will use the Camp Stein velocity gradient to estimate injection velocity required to create very small flocs. The important parameter for floc break up is a force that can be obtained from the velocity gradient multiplied by the dynamic viscosity.

Solving :eq:`eq_G_CS_porous_media` for the approach velocity, :math:`v_a`, we obtain

.. math::

    v_a = \left( G_{CS}^2 \frac{2\nu d_{sand}}{f^{\phi}} \frac{\phi^4}{(1-\phi)} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}

to estimate the injection area that should be used to break up flocs entering the sand bed.

    Re_phi = v_inject*d_sand/(pc.viscosity_kinematic(Temperature)*(1-Porosity))
    f_phi = 300/Re_phi + 3.5
    v_inject = ((G_CS**2 * 2*pc.viscosity_kinematic(Temperature)*d_sand/f_phi * Porosity**4/(1-Porosity))**(1/3)).to(u.m/u.s)

    injection_port_width =     (injection_port_spacing/(v_inject/v_approach)).to(u.mm)
    print('The injection port width would be ',injection_port_width,'.')
    print('The injection velocity would be ',v_inject.to(u.mm/u.s),'.')

The analysis above suggests that the pore water velocity required to break flocs down to a dimension of :math:`20 \mu m` is approximately 90 mm/s. This is based on a VERY bad guesstimate of the relationship between floc size and shear.

We need to know how much energy would be expended to force the water through this high velocity injection zone. Once the water enters the sand it will spread radially in all directions. As the water spreads it will slow down and the head loss per distance traveled will decrease. We need to integrate this head loss over the first few centimeters to get an estimate of the injection head loss.
