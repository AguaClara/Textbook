Filtration Design Challenge

1)
~~
Calculate the turbidity of the backwash water. Ideally use POST data to do this. An alternative would be to use CUWFP data.

2)
~~
An engineer suggests that you should install a roughing filter uphill from an AguaClara plant to improve its ability to treat turbid water. This is a real question from a conference presentation in Honduras. How would you reply to this suggestion. Consider how to answer without offending the questioner. Use the required sizes of the unit processes to guide your response.

3)
~~
Why don't StaRS filters experience surface clogging?

4)
~~
Explain why particles are captured at flow constrictions inside sand filters.

5)
~~
Explain the role of coagulant nanoparticles in the capture of particles by flow constrictions.

6)
~~
Explain why a flow constriction in a filter has a limited capacity to collect particles.
