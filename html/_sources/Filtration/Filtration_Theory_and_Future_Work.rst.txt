Filtration model
================

The filtration model is based on the insight that rapid sand filters have an active filtration zone that slowly progresses down through the filter as the active zone fills to maximum capacity at the upstream end. A clean bed of sand is ineffective at capturing small particles as evidenced by the poor initial performance after backwash. Thus it is apparently that previously deposited particles play a key role in subsequent capture of particles.

Interception!
Flow constrictions - converging streamlines move particles closer to the pore wall. Previously deposited particles form constrictions. The constrictions are the most likely location for particles to collide with deposited particles.

Maximum shear sets a minimum constriction opening size!
As particles gradually deposit in an ever shrinking flow constriction the velocity through the constriction increases and the velocity gradient at the wall increases. Eventually the bond strength of the coagulant nanoparticles is not great enough to capture suspended particles that collide with the deposited particles. The flow constriction reaches a minimum diameter and subsequent suspended flocs flow right through the constriction.

The gradual creation of more flow constrictions results in an almost linear increase in head loss as a function of the volume of deposited flocs.
