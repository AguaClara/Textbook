Rapid Mix Design
*******************

As of 2018 the design for AguaClara rapid mix units has been based on the goal of achieving a target energy dissipation rate. This in turn was based on the assumption that it was important to rapidly mix the coagulant with the water, perhaps to minimize the self-aggregation of coagulant nanoparticles. We don't yet have any experimental evidence that rapid mixing is important and it is quite likely that the energy dissipation rate found in the hydraulic flocculator is sufficient to provide the required mixing.

The design requirements for fluid mixing of the coagulant is an area that needs research. If the goal is to achieve a velocity gradient for a number of seconds, then this design will be the same as that developed in the flocculator section. Until we have clear guidance on the goal of rapid mix we will not provide a detailed design here.
