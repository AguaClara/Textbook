Sedimentation Introduction

.. _Sedimentation Unit Process Overview:

Sedimentation a gravity-driven unit process in which suspended flocs are settled out from water. Large flocs made up of many primary particles and coagulant will settle if given enough time. Sedimentation is commonly preceded by coagulation/flocculation processes - coagulation/flocculation aim to form flocs which will be large enough to settle in sedimentation - and is commonly followed by filtration processes for further treatment. Sludge consolidation processes are often present alongside sedimentation to reduce the waste stream of settled flocs. Optimizing sedimentation is important because the more particles that sedimentation can remove, the fewer particles the filter will have to remove. This is good because filters can only handle a small amount of solids, and cleaning the filters with backwash uses a lot of water so we want to reduce the number of backwashes. The goal of sedimentation is to concentrate a waste stream of flocs, or sludge.

To introduce you to sedimentation, we will begin with a simple example. If a jar of water filled with flocs was left at rest, flocs would begin to settle due to gravitational forces pulling them down. Large flocs would settle first, but if left for long enough, all flocs would settle to the bottom of the jar. In its most basic form, the jar represents a sedimentation tank in which flocculated water is treated. Settled flocs become waste and the water on the top of the jar, referred to as the supernatant, becomes the settled water.

Constraints of space, time, and cost make it important to optimize the settling process. It would not be realistic to design water treatment systems that use the basic jar-like system to settle flocs because large flow rates would require unreasonably large reactor volumes and long retention times. The goal of sedimentation reactor design is to employ geometries that promote settling and allow for fast treatment with small footprints.

What if we were to do the same jar experiment with raw water that did not go through successful coagulation and flocculation? Would we observe the same settling and successful particle removal? To answer this, we must recall information learned in the section on coagulation and flocculation; those two treatment processes serve to destabilize and agglomerate particles to form flocs that will be heavy enough to settle. If the particles are colloids and are not destabilized, no amount of time will allow for the settling. This emphasizes the fact that successful sedimentation can only happen with successful coagulation and flocculation steps before it. 

The three main steps that need to be accomplished for a sedimentation system to be successful are as follows:

1) Suspended flocs need to be able to settle out of the water.
2) Settling flocs need to be able to move from wherever they settle to a lower section of the tank.
3) Accumulated flocs at the bottom of the tank need to be removed.

Sedimentation is ubiquitous in water treatment. Nevertheless,  the process is very complex with many failure modes and there are many active research areas. The following sections will explore the state of conventional sedimentation systems and their challenges, gaps in knowledge, and the AguaClara approach to sedimentation.


***************************************
Conventional Sedimentation Systems
***************************************
- Components of the reactors


- Examples of systems:
  - Two main categories are:
    - horizontal sedimentation
    - vertical sedimentation

  - Differences between them include
    - Bottom type (flat, sloped)
    - Sludge removal apparatus (mostly mechanical but with different variations)
    - Flow distribution systems

Note: this chapter will not deal with other advanced clarification technologies past this point, except in making comparisons with AguaClara technology. Other interesting areas of advanced clarification include:

- ballasted Sedimentation (Actiflow)
- Superpulsator
- etc

Sedimentation Challenges and Gaps in Knowledge
***********************************************

Sedimentation Challenges:

- Flow circulation (and floc rise) from uneven flow distribution
- Floc blanket design and use challenges

  .. _Floc_blankets:

  Floc blankets
  ==================

  .. todo:: download CEPIS design files and create local copies to avoid problems with this hyperlink failing. (bibliotecavirtual.minam.gob.pe/biam/bitstream/id/5657/BIV00012.pdf)

  See the Pan American Health Organization, (PAHO) manual on theory of rapid sand filtration plants (page 289) for reasons why floc blankets should not be used! According to PAHO floc blankets are not recommended for small communities who lack highly trained personal to operate the plant and floc blanket should only be used where plant flow rates and water quality are constant. Each of these constraints was due to the inadequate design of previous floc blanket reactors that made operation difficult.

  .. _Floc_blanket_hypotheses:

  Floc blanket hypotheses
  ------------------------

  The floc blanket mechanism responsible for reduced settled water turbidity has been elusive.
  - not flocculation between particles delivered from the flocculator because $G\theta$ generated by the shear of the settling flocs and the hydraulic residence time of the floc blanket is insufficient to cause significant
  - The floc blanket consists of settling flocs that are maintained in suspension by the upwardly flowing water.

- Sludge accumulation


Gaps in Knowledge:

- Empirical standards (10 state standards)
  - Settle capture velocity guidelines

- No understanding of scaling effects

- "last significant paper on tube settlers published in 1978" - needs confirmation/more details

***************************************
AguaClara Innovations
***************************************
Note: focus this section on just explaining the 3 problem areas that exist that AguaClara tech focuses on. Do not go into detail about each component because that will be detailed more in Sed_Design

The improved performance is due to 3 factors.
- improved inlet system to prevent circulation (inlet manifold with diffusers)
- self-sustaining floc blanket (bottom geometry and diffusers for floc blanket)
- prevent sludge accumulation and allow for self-cleaning (bottom geometry jet reverser and floc hopper)
