Review: Python
******************
In the beginning of AguaClara, there was an 'automated design tool' (ADT) to create full plant designs given a few input parameters. This design tool compiled in MathCAD 15 and output .dwg files of the hydraulic design in AutoCAD  

The AguaClara design philosophy is to be entirely open-source. Python_ was chosen as the design language of AguaClara due to its huge community, diverse functionality, and enormous amount of resources and documentation. AguaClara keeps all of its code and research on GitHub_ within `repositories in this organization <https://github.com/AguaClara>`_.
