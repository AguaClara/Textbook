Flow Control and Measurement Design Challenge
*********************************************

#. Create a design for a chemical dose controller using AIDE. Then take that design and calculate the maximum coagulant dose that it will deliver.
#. An AguaClara plant will be upgraded from 20 L/s to 30 L/s by adding two sedimentation tanks, increasing the head loss through the flocculator, and adding an additional StaRS filter. Give the current design specs for the CDC. Propose the most cost effective modification to the CDC to handle the additional flow.
#. Determine if the LFOM diameter will need to be increased for a 20 L/s to 30 L/s plant upgrade.
