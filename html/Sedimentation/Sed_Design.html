<h1>Foundational Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#foundational-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To understand how sedimentation works, a few key concepts must first be developed. This includes understanding how and why flocs move in water. Remember, the goal of sedimentation reactor design is to optimize the floc-settling process.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminal-velocity">
<h2>Terminal Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#terminal-velocity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As flocs settle in water, they will fall at a speed dictated by the weight of the floc, the buoyancy of the floc, and drag from the water. These three forces - the gravitational weight force, the buoyant force, and the drag force - dictate the speed at which a floc falls and are detailed in the following free body diagram. We care about determining the speed at which flocs will fall because knowing this information will help inform our sedimentation reactor design criteria.</p>

<p>Terminal velocity is a function of fluid density, floc density, gravity, particle diameter, and the drag coefficient. To calculate velocity, all of those inputs must be determined.</p>
<p>The first component that we will focus on is the drag coefficient, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D\)</span>. The drag coefficient is function of Reynolds Number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span>, and the characteristic flow around a particle. As a reminder, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = \frac{v_t D}{\nu}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_t\)</span> is the velocity of the fluid, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is the length scale, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> is kinematic viscosity.</p>
<p>Drag coefficients are used to describe flow around a particle.</p>

<p>The flow around the particle and the Reynolds Number can be described in the laminar, turbulent, or turbulent-boundary regions. In the laminar region, which holds when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re &lt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = \frac{24}{Re}\)</span>. This region of laminar flow, represented as the straight line on the log-log plot, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = \frac{24}{Re}\)</span> is referred to as Stokes Law. You’ll notice that the line for Stokes Law shown in the figure extends past the laminar region. This was done because it highlights that even though Stokes Law is not exactly correct past the turbulent region, it is still a pretty good approximation near <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = 1\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s consider the drag coefficient diagram at Reynolds numbers of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^5\)</span>. We notice that there is a “bump” in the plot, in which drag coefficients drop. This is because at really high Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer around the particle became turbulent. This causes the wake behind the particle to be a little smaller, leading to a slight reduction in drag. The drag coefficient decreases, but the total drag force does not necessarily decrease (and likely keeps on increasing).</p>
<p>To understand this phenomenon, think about a golf ball. Golf balls are designed with dimpled surfaces because the dimpled surface forces the transition described above to happen at lower Reynolds numbers. The dimples initiate turbulence in the boundary layer and cause a slight reduction in the drag coefficient. Thus, dimpled golf balls can travel further than smooth ones.</p>
<p>You might think: why aren’t more surfaces dimpled? If I want my car to get better mileage, should I dimple its surface to take advantage of the same turbulent boundary layer properties as the golf ball? But before you go and damage some metal, let’s think. If a car and golf ball are traveling through air at the same speed, what will be their relative Reynolds numbers? We know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = \frac{v_t D}{\nu}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{golfball} &lt;&lt; D_{car}\)</span>. The relative length scales mean that cars have much higher Reynolds numbers than the golf ball. In fact, the Reynolds number for a car is so high that it is already past the point that the boundary layer becomes turbulent. The golf ball needs to be dimpled because its Reynolds numbers are not so large that they will pass the turbulent boundary transition.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the realm of water treatment. We care about drag coefficients and terminal velocities because they help describe how flocs will move in water. Flocs tend to exist in the region between 1&lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span> &lt; 10. This region is not perfectly described by Stokes Law, but it is used as an appropriate approximation. We have already solved for the general equation for terminal velocity using the force balance approach. Now, we can solve for a terminal velocity equation specifically in the laminar region.</p>
<p>Plug the drag coefficient and Reynolds numbers for laminar flow into the general terminal velocity equation:</p>

<p>Again, we can draw a parallel with the Moody Diagram. The general form of the terminal velocity equation is like the Darcy-Weisbach equation; it is always true. The terminal velocity in the laminar flow region is like the Hagen-Poiselle equation; it is only good for laminar flow. We will use the laminar specific condition because we are working with flocs with low Reynolds numbers.</p>
<p>Our equations for terminal velocity depend on the density of a floc. As discussed in previous sections, we know that there is a specific relationship between the density of a floc and the diameter of a floc because flocs are fractals and as flocs get bigger, their density gets lower. We can account for the size and density relationship by modifying the terminal velocity equation. [[MORE INFO NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE FLOCCULATION SECTION]]</p>

</div>
<p>Three important regions are highlighted in the plot. At small floc diameters, less than 10 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, terminal velocity is less that 0.1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. A terminal velocity this low would require extremely large sedimentation tanks for reasonable treatment. Because large sedimentation tanks are costly and unfeasible, we use flocculation to aggregate particles and achieve floc sizes of greater diameters and higher terminal velocities.</p>
<p>For floc diameters around 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, the terminal velocity is about 1.2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. AguaClara plate settlers are designed to settle out flocs of this size (particles dropping at 1.2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>) so the smallest floc that we can capture is 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>. This will be explored in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>Flocs with large diameters around 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> have a terminal velocity of about 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. In our sedimentation tanks, which are upflow sedimentation tanks, we have water flowing up at about 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span> to capture a 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> floc. These flocs are clearly visible but are small. This is what we design our sedimentation tanks to be able to capture. This will be explored in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>Our understanding of floc terminal velocity suggests that we can decide the size of the floc that we want our sedimentation tank to capture. If we decide that we want to capture flocs that are 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> or larger, we know that we must design for water flowing at 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. Alternatively, we know that if we design a reactor in which water flows at 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>, we will only be able to capture flocs that are 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> or larger. This begins our discussion of sedimentation tank design.</p>

<h2>Capture Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#capture-velocity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Settle capture velocity is defined as the velocity of the slowest settling particle that a sedimentation tank captures reliably. It is a property of the geometry of the sedimentation tank. Because it is a property of geometry, we can use it as an important design tool; because we can control reactor geometry, we can control the sizes of particles that we can settle.</p>
<p>Note: there are a couple of different terms used to describe the sedimentation process. We can say that sedimentation tanks “capture” particles when particles are settled out. We can also say that sedimentation tanks “remove” particles. Both terms refer to the process of particles or floc settling out of suspension in water. If a particle is captured or removed by a sedimentation tank, it means that the particle is stuck in the tank and that water leaving the reactor will have fewer particles in it.</p>
<p>We will develop our definition of settle capture velocity using examples of a horizontal flow and vertical flow sedimentation tanks. It should be noted that there are many idealizations and simplifications made for modeling sedimentation tanks. We assume that water will move through the reactor as expected (in the case of the horizontal flow sedimentation tank, from one end to the other), but we know that there are many more fluids complications than are described here. We assume that everything is moving at the average velocity and there are no turbulence or velocity profiles. For the time being, we will ignore what will happen to particles once they are captured by the sedimentation tank. Our intuition tells us that particles which settle will need to be removed somehow, and that is correct. This will be discussed in later sections. For now, we only care about capturing the particles, and later we will care about what we do with them once they are captured.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>In the “worst case scenario”, how far must a particle fall to reach the bottom of the tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>The “worst case scenario” is the condition in which a particle must travel the furthest in order to be successfully captured by the sedimentation tank. We assume that particles are evenly distributed throughout the height and width of the reactor entrance. Therefore, a particle entering at the top of the entrance of the reactor would need to fall a distance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> to reach the bottom. Any particle entering from a position lower than the top of the tank would need to fall a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt; H\)</span>. We refer to the “worst case scenario” pathway as the “critical path” of the particle in the sedimentation tank design because this is the case which we must design to treat. The height that the particle must fall is called the “critical height”, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c\)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>How fast must the particle fall?</li>
</ol>
<p>We know that for a particle to fall to the bottom successfully, it needs to fall fast enough that it can reach the bottom before the water that is carrying it leaves the reactor. Water is carrying the particle across the reactor at the horizontal velocity speed, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_H\)</span>. Gravity is causing the particle to settle at its terminal velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_t\)</span>. In order to reach the bottom, that settling velocity needs to be the capture velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_c\)</span>, to ensure that the particle will reach the bottom of the reactor. We can see the critical path of the particle in the following figure.</p>

<p>We can make some substitutions into the equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_c\)</span> to solve for it in explicit terms of reactor plan view area. We are interested in plan view area because this will indicate the efficiency and cost of an associated reactor.</p>

<p>Thus, we have capture velocity which is a descriptor of a sedimentation tank. It determines how fast a particle has to settle in order to be reliably captured by a particular sedimentation tank, assuming idealized flow. The capture velocity is not a particle property, but rather a sedimentation tank property.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Will any particles that are smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> be captured in the sedimentation tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>This question is important because as stated in the beginning of this section, our discussion assumed that the particle in question was 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>. If we design a sedimentation tank to capture particles that are 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, we also have to understand the impact of our design on particles smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, think about the two extremes of our reactor.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We could have a small particle entering the reactor at the top, defining the critical path in the same “worst case scenario”. This particle would not be successfully captured by the tank because its terminal velocity is less than the capture velocity, meaning that it doesn’t have enough time in the reactor to settle.</li>
<li>We could have a small particle entering the reactor near the bottom, in a “best case scenario”. In this case, the particle does not have a large distance to fall because it is already close to the bottom of the tank. Small particles entering the reactor may be able to be caputured by a tank designed for particles 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> or larger, but it depends on the height at which they enter the reactor.</li>

<li>How far must a particle fall relative to the fluid to not be carried out the exit?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note how this question is different from the question we asked for the horizontal flow sedimentation tank. In the horizontal flow sedimentation tank, particles could settle to the bottom of the reactor. We care about particles settling to the bottom because we assume that if particles hit the bottom of the reactor, then they would be captured and would not leave the reactor. Remember, the goal of sedimentation is to remove particles from suspension in water. In the vertical flow sedimentation tank, we also want to remove particles from suspension, but because there is a different geometry, we are now interested in the relative movement of particle to water. If a particle is falling due to the forces of gravity, but also water is pushing up on it, the only way for a particle to remain in the reactor is if it either falls at the same velocity or faster than the water is pushing it.</p>
<p>If a particle is falling at the same velocity that water is moving it, it will be stationary in the reactor. Water flowing through the reactor moves a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, which means that a stationary particle must settle the same distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in the same time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>.

<p>It doesn’t matter whether water is flowing horizontally or vertically in the tank. What determines the capture velocity is the flow rate and the plan view area of the sedimentation tank.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Will any particles that are smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> be captured in the sedimentation tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>This question is surprisingly complex because we have to consider what we have learned so far about sedimentation and also recall what we have learned about flocculation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the simple sedimentation approach. We can compare the vertical flow sedimentation tank with the horizontal flow sedimentation tank. In a horizontal flow tank, the capture of particles smaller than the design particle (35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>) is possible depending on the height which the particle enters the reactor. In a vertical flow tank, all particles enter the reactor at the same height (which is the bottom of the tank). This means that any particle entering the reactor will need to fall the same distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> relative to the water if it will be captured. If particles smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> enter the reactor, they will not be captured because they are not able to settle fast enough.</p>
<p>However, we must also consider potential flocculation processes that could occur in the sedimentation tank. A sedimentation tank is still subject to the same laws of fluids as the flocculator, meaning that there will still be shear in the reactor. While it may not be as much shear as that introduced in the flocculator, there are still velocity gradients which mean that there could be some additional flocculation happening in the sedimentation tank. In the flocculator, the main mechanism that led to flocculation was the deformation of fluid which caused particles to collide. In the sedimentation tank, the main mechanism that can lead to flocculation is velocity gradients. Flocculation is provided by an opportunity for collision by differences in relative velocities of particles. Big particles in the sedimentation tank settle out but are still in suspension, and small particles continue to move up through the large particles. There is relative velocity between particles based on their terminal velocities.</p>
<p>Understanding relative velocities is very important to understand how vertical flow sedimentation tanks work. Let’s consider an example to develop our understanding of differential sedimentation. Imagine that two people are skydiving; one person is 150 lbs and the other person is 300 lbs. Assume that both people are using the same size parachutes and are jumping out of the same stationary helicopter. If the 150 lb person jumps out first and the 300 lb person jumps out a few moments after, what will happen? The 300 lb person will fall faster than the 150 lb person, causing a collision in the air. In a sedimentation tank, we would describe the collision due to differential sedimentation as flocculation because particles are colliding and growing.</p>
<p>Now that we understand differential settling and the potential for flocculation in a sedimentation tank, let’s revisit the original question. Can smaller particles be captured? The answer is that smaller particles can be captured only if they collide with other particles and grow so that they have a terminal velocity that is greater than the capture velocity. This flocculation that happens in the sedimentation tank is an additional mechanism for removing particles.</p>
<p>There are some important differences between horizontal and vertical sedimentation tanks. Many of these points will be discussed later when we learn specifically about the AguaClara design process, but it is important to get introduced to these ideas now:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<h2>“Sedimentation Tank as a Circuit” Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#sedimentation-tank-as-a-circuit-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand how we will use flow distribution as a primary design constraint, we will develop a concept called the “sedimentation tank as a circuit”. This concept will be elaborated on as you learn about the sedimentation tank components and design, but we will introduce it now because it is a driving principle for flow distribution in AguaClara sedimentation tanks. The chapter on Manifold design will be very useful to understand some of these fluids concepts. [[[[link]]]]</p>
<p>An electrical circuit is a path in which electrons flow from a voltage or current source. Electrical circuits frequently have resistors, which are passive electrical components to create resistance in the flow of electric current. What does this have to do with sedimentation tanks? In our “sedimentation tank as a circuit” concept, we will draw parallels between how electrons flow through a circuit to how water flows through the sedimentation tank.</p>
<p>The AguaClara treatment train is designed so that flow is driven by potential energy. The entrance of the sedimentation tank, where water comes from the flocculator, is the source of the flow. Water then moves through the sedimentation tank and exits to the filter. At different points throughout the flow of water in the sedimentation tank, there are changes in piezometric head from fluid acceleration/deceleration and head loss. In the development of our circuit concept, piezometric head is like electrical resistance.</p>
<p>In electrical circuits, electrons will travel the path of least resistance in a parallel path system. Water is similar in that it will flow in the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>[[[[figure]]]]</p>
<p>The figure shows flow through a sedimentation system in which there are two sedimentation bays working in parallel. Each bay has multiple components through which piezometric head changes; wherever a resistor symbol is shown, it means that there is a difference in piezometric head in that section of pipe. We want to understand what is going on between the influent channel and the effluent channel so that we can design to control head loss and fluid flow.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal is to have even flow distribution. It is bad if different flow paths have different head losses or changes in piezometric head. We must consider this between sedimentation bays (comparing each bay to each other) and within a single sedimentation bay (comparing the flows at different points within the sedimentation bay). We want to limit differences in “resistance” to ensure equal flow distribution. Therefore, we define</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>anything that makes parallel flow paths different is “bad” head loss.</li>
<li>anything that increases head loss through all of the paths, to make differences between the paths less significant, is “good” head loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can artificially introduce the second form of head loss to dominate the resistance and render small variations due to pressure recovery insignificant. We will go through each part of the sedimentation tank to understand how these goals drive AguaClara designs. As we learn about each component, we will attempt to categorize its contribution into creating “good” or “bad” head loss.</p>

<p>In this section, we will develop a conceptual understanding of the sedimentation tank using figures and images. We will be using a mixture of terminology typically found in water treatment settings and AguaClara-specific terminology. We will discuss the different parts of the sedimentation tank in the sequence that a parcel of water would encounter it, from the beginning of the unit process to the end. The three main sections are 1) how water enters the sedimentation tank, 2) how water moves through the sedimentation tank, and 3) how water leaves the sedimentation tank.</p>

<h2>1) How water enters the sedimentation tank<a class="headerlink" href="#how-water-enters-the-sedimentation-tank" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="influent-channel">
<h3>Influent Channel<a class="headerlink" href="#influent-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After water exits the flocculator, it is ready for sedimentation. In AguaClara plants, there is one flocculator per treatment train. However, depending on the plant flow rate, one plant may have multiple sedimentation units operating in parallel; we call each of these sedimentation units a ‘bay’ or a ‘tank’. Because there may be multiple sedimentation bays, we have to distribute flocculated water between the bays. To do this, we have an <strong>influent channel</strong>, which receives water from the flocculator and passes it to the sedimentation bays. The channel is long, concrete, and relatively shallow. The objective of the channel is to distribute water and flocs to the sedimentation bays without allowing any settling of flocs in the influent channel. The minimum velocity in the influent channel is about 0.15 mm/s to prevent flocs from settling. In the bottom of the channel, there are pipes that lead to the bottom of each sedimentation bay.</p>
<p>Does the water in the influent channel get evenly distributed between the different bays? If not, which bay will receive the most water? [[[[link to Manifold chapter]]]] We know from our understanding of fluids and flow distribution that in a pipe (or channel) with multiple orifices that is closed at one end, the distribution of flow is nonuniform along the length of the pipe; it is decelerating. This nonuniformity is due to differences in velocity and pressure in different parts of the pipe. Where else in fluids have we discussed decelerating floc? We have discussed this in flow expansions. And what do we know about pressure in flow expansions? We know that there is higher pressure and slower velocities. At the end of the pipe, there is low velocity and thus high pressure, driving the flow through the orifices at the end. For this same reason, a channel with orifices will have greatest flow delivery to the last orifice. Is this type of head loss “good” or “bad”? In our definition of “good” and “bad”, we stated that “bad” head loss creates unequal flow in parallel flow paths. The head loss in the influent channel is therefore “bad” head loss because it can lead to different bays in parallel receiving different flows.</p>
<p>Sedimentation units have multiple bays for a few different reasons. Plants with higher flow rates require more sedimentation bays because the flow through each bay is limited by other design constraints, namely upflow velocity, which will be discussed later. Additionally, it is good to have more than one bay for maintenance purposes; if one bay needs to be cleaned, we want to always have another that can be working. Pipe stubs can be used to plug the entrance hole to a sedimentation bay to shut it down for maintenance.</p>
<p>Of note is that the sedimentation tank influent channel is located directly next to a drain channel. This drain channel was built to remove poorly flocculated water from the treatment train. If an operator observes poor flocculation, they can change the chemical dosing in an attempt to improve flocculation. In the meantime, they will want to dump the poorly flocculated water to avoid poor effluent quality. Operators can plug the entrance hole to the sedimentation bays, allowing the influent channel to fill with water. Once water reaches the height of the wall separating it from the drain channel, the water will pour over from the influent channel into the drain channel. This allows operators to easily dump poorly treated water and then easily restart sedimentation once flocculation performance improves.</p>

<h3>Bottom Geometry: Influent Manifold, Diffusers, and Jet Reverser<a class="headerlink" href="#bottom-geometry-influent-manifold-diffusers-and-jet-reverser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, we will focus on a single bay of the sedimentation system. Flocculated water enters a pipe in the bottom of the influent channel and travels down a few feet. The pipe then has a 90 degree bend and extends along the bottom of the entire length of the sedimentation bay. This section of pipe that distributes water at the bottom of the sedimentation bay is referred to as the <strong>influent manifold</strong>.</p>
<p>Water exits the influent manifold through a series of orifices and <strong>diffusers</strong> in the bottom of the pipe. Orifices refer to the holes that are drilled into the underside of the manifold while diffusers are what we call short stubs of pipe that extend down from the orifice, perpendicular to the influent manifold. The orifices and diffusers point down to the bottom of the sedimentation bay and extend along the length of the pipe at regular intervals to ensure that water is evenly distributed within the bay. The ends of the diffuser tubes are flattened so that they are thin rectangles and when placed side-by-side achieve a line-jet effect. The end of the influent manifold is capped.</p>
<p>[[need to discuss the energy dissipation rate and floc breakup]]</p>
<p>[[NEED TO TALK ABOUT FLOW DISTRIBUTION / MANIFOLDS PPT]]
Recall the discussion about flow distribution in the influent channel. We know that the sedimentation bay furthest away from the flocculator would receive the most flow from the influent channel due to fluids principles. For the same reasons, the orifice at the end of the influent manifold would receive the most flow in the pipe. Is the type of head loss introduced by the 90 degree bend “good” or “bad”? This head loss is “good” because it increases head loss through all paths equally.</p>
<p>Is the type of head loss in the influent manifold “good” or “bad”? Like the influent channel, it would be “bad” head loss because it can lead to different flow along the length of the sedimentation tank; the end of the sedimentation tank would receive more flow than the beginning.</p>
<p>However, the diffuser system was designed to greatly impact the overall flow distribution in an attempt to make the flow more equal in all parts of the system. Diffusers are designed to introduce 1 cm of head loss [[[[link to derivation]]]]. This is “good” head loss because it uniformly increases the head loss through all flow paths. The “good” head loss from the diffusers dominate the “bad” head loss from the influent channel and manifold, making differences between the paths less significant.</p>
<p>The influent manifold diffuser system straightens the fluid jets that are exiting the manifold so that they have no horizontal velocity component. This is critical because even a small horizontal velocity causes a large scale circulation that transports flocs directly to the top of the sedimentation tank. Influent manifolds without flow straightening diffusers are commonly used in vertical flow sedimentation tanks including designs by leading manufacturers.</p>
<p>The diffusers create a line jet that spans the entire length of the sedimentation tank. This line jet enters the bay going down, but we want the water to ultimately flow up to make our vertical flow sedimentation tank. To get the flow to redirect upwards, we use a <strong>jet reverser</strong>, which is half of a pipe that is laid in the bottom of the bay.</p>
<p>You may be wondering, why do we need a jet reverser in the first place? Why don’t we just have the diffusers point up to avoid having to change the flow in the first place? The answer has multiple components.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the diffusers were to point up, they could clog if anything settles in them. While this is unlikely due to the high velocity of flow exiting the small cross-sectional area diffuser, it is something that is avoided by pointing them down.</li>
<li>If flow were just to point directly up, it would not have an opportunity to sufficiently spread into the width of the sedimentation bay, which could lead to “short-circuiting” and poor flow distribution overall.</li>
<li>The jet reverser functions as a way to keep flocs suspended by ensuring that anything that settles will be propelled back up from the force of the diffuser jet. Because the diffusers and jet reverser are responsible for resuspension, their design must meet minimum velocity requirements [[[[link]]]]. The jet reverser and diffuser alignment is not symmetrical; the diffusers are offset from the jet reverser centerline. This is intentionally done to ensure that the diffuser jet never collapses to promote a floc blanket, which will be discussed next.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of research interest in determining the optimal upflow velocity for floc blankets considering that high velocity is better for resuspension but breaks more flocs. Currently, AguaClara plants use an upflow velocity of 1 mm/s.</p>
<p>[[[[PICTURE OF FLAT BOTTOM, CENTERED, and OFFSET JET]]]]</p>
<p>As shown above, in a flat bottom geometry, flocs settle in the corners of the tank because there is no direct flow of water to resuspend it. Flocs fall in such a way that the corners of the tank will fill first, with more and more flocs settling until the angle of repose is created. This angle that is occupied by flocs suggests that if we want to avoid having flocs settle, we should fill the sides of the tank in with concrete and create a sloped bottom so that there are no surfaces for settling.</p>
<p>The influent manifold, diffusers, and jet reverser work with a <strong>sloped bottom geometry</strong> in an AguaClara plant. The slope on either side of the diffusers is at a 50 degree angle. The bottom geometry allows for smooth flow expansion to the entire plan view area of the bay, and ensures that all flocs that settle are transported to the jet reverser. The diffusers do not touch the bottom of the tank so that flocs on both sides of the diffuser can fall into the jet reverser for resuspension. Thus, there is no accumulation of settled flocs in the main sedimentation basin. Sludge that is allowed to accumulate in the bottom of sedimentation tanks in tropical and temperate climates decomposes anaerobically and generates methane. The methane forms gas bubbles that carry suspended solids to the top of the sedimentation tank and cause a reduction in particle removal efficiency. The AguaClara sedimentation tank bottom geometry prevents sludge accumulation while also ensuring good flow distribution.</p>
<p>So we know that the diffusers, jet reverser, and sloped bottom ensure that no sludge accumulates in the bay by creating a system to resuspend any settled flocs. What are the failure modes for this system? For one, we need to ensure that the jet of water exiting the diffuser is able to maintain its upward direction after the jet reverser. The jet is influenced by the flows that are coming down the sloped sides of the tank. Thus, the jet must have enough momentum to remain upwards even with the momentum from other flows downwards. We can control the momentum of the jet by controlling the cross-sectional area of the diffuser slot. A smaller cross-sectional area will increase the velocity of the jet but the mass is the same because the flow rate for the plant is the same, thus increasing the momentum.</p>

<h2>2) How water moves through the sedimentation tank<a class="headerlink" href="#how-water-moves-through-the-sedimentation-tank" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="floc-blanket">
<h3>Floc Blanket<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-blanket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The line jet from the diffusers enters the jet reverser to force flow up through the sedimentation bay. The vertical upward jet momentum is used to resuspend flocs that have settled to the bottom of the sedimentation tank. The resuspended flocs form a fluidized bed which is called a <strong>floc blanket</strong>. The bed is fluidized because flocs are kept in suspension by the upflowing water.</p>
<p>For a floc blanket to form, a sedimentation system requires that 1) all flocs be returned to the bottom of the sedimentation tank and 2) requires that all settled flocs be resuspended by incoming water. As will be discussed soon, plate settlers are used to return flocs to the bottom of the bay, while the jet reverser and sloped bottom geometry allow for floc resuspension. Any surface with a horizontal component in a sedimentation tank must be sloped to allow settled flocs to return to the resuspension zone. A flat bottom geometry does not allow for the formation of a floc blanket, as discussed previously.</p>
<p>Floc blankets improve the performance of a sedimentation tank and reduces settled water turbidity by a factor of 10 (Garland et al., 2017) for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by providing additional collision potential. The high concentration of particles, with a suspended solids concentrations of approximately 1-5 g/L, leads to an increase in collisions and particle aggregation. As discussed for vertical flow sedimentation tanks, flocculation can occur in a floc blanket due to shear from suspended flocs which are colliding and growing. Fluidized flocs provide a collision potential of a few thousand. This collision potential is small compared to the collision potential from the flocculator. So how does a small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> cause a large reduction in turbidity? The two-fold answer may be that the lower <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> value provides an opportunity for all flocs to grow larger without floc breakup. The high concentration of flocs provides many opportunities for clay particles to collide with big flocs, but it is not clear if or when those collisions are successful. We also want to know which flocs are active or inactive in collisions in the floc blanket. [[[[link to derivation]]]]</li>
<li>by creating a uniform vertical velocity of water entering the plate settlers.</li>
<li>by transporting excess floc consolidation pipe with a drain port, called the floc hopper. The floc hopper is discussed in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have just explained three reasons that the floc blanket improves sedimentation effluent quality, we do not yet have a model for floc blanket performance. Additional research is needed to create this model, and to determine optimal upflow velocity.</p>
<p>Consider the requirements that we have stated for the creation of the floc blanket. Could we design for a floc blanket in a treatment plant that experiences flow variability? There are some plants that only run for certain hours of the day. While this intermittent flow would impact many parts of the plant, how would it impact the floc blanket specifically? Can a settled floc blanket be resuspended?</p>
<p>We do not yet have a way to design for variable or intermittent flow rates in a sedimentation tank [[is this true?]]. The ability of a settled floc blanket to resuspend is dependent on the characteristics of the flocs themselves. For example, sticky and clumpy flocs would have a more difficult time resuspending because they tend to settle into hard masses without sufficient upflow velocities. The capacity for resuspension may require site-specific analysis. The AguaClara pilot PF300 in testing at the Cornell Water Treatment Plant is going to determine whether the floc blanket at that site will be able to itermittent flow; the pilot plant and the Cornell Water Treatment Plant will be offline from around 10pm - 5am daily.</p>
<p>It is of interesting note that the suspended solids concentration in the floc blanket is approximately 1-5 g/L. This concentration corresponds to measurements of thousands of NTU, which is remarkably turbid water. A water treatment plant could have 5 NTU water entering the plant, and water in the bottom of the sedimentation tank could have 1000 NTU. This is one clue that there are interesting things happening in the floc blanket; the bottom of the sedimentation tank can be a completely different world from the rest of the treatment process.</p>
<p>An understanding the bottom of a sedimentation tank is important to understand how sedimentation tanks work. However, most sedimentation tanks do not allow the operator to observe what is happening. Without being able to observe the bottom of the sedimentation tank, an operator would not know what is happening or if a floc blanket is forming successfully. AguaClara research teams are working to develop a probe to get data on floc blanket performance. Until then, there are two ways to learn about the floc blanket. The AguaClara plant at the University of Zamorano in Honduras was built with a translucent wall on one end of a sedimentation bay. This allows students and operators to observe the floc blanket. The AguaClara pilot PF300 in testing at the Cornell Water Treatment Plant has small sample ports installed into the side of the reactor. Drawing a sample of water at different heights of the reactor will indicate if a floc blanket has grown, and how deep it is.</p>
<p>Let’s recap some important conclusions from this section on the floc blanket.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The low G flocculation in the floc blanket may allow for the rapid growth of the flocs coming from the flocculator.</li>
<li>The floc blanket reduces the effluent turbidity from the sedimentation tank.</li>
<li>The floc blanket requires a mechanism to keep the flocs resuspended:
- an upflow velocity of approximately 1 mm/s is the current AguaClara design parameter;
- sloped surfaces to return flocs to the resuspension point is necessary to prevent floc build-up.</li>
<li>We do not have a model for floc blanket performance, meaning that we don’t know the optimal floc blanket depth or optimal upflow velocity.</li>
<li>We do not yet have a consistent way for operators to observe the floc blanket.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="floc-hopper">
<h3>Floc Hopper<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-hopper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>floc hopper</strong> is a “weir” that provides an opportunity for floc consolidation. The floc hopper controls the depth of the floc blanket because as the floc blanket grows, it will eventually reach the top of the floc hopper. Because flocs are more dense than water, the flocs “spill” over the edge of the floc hopper which allows the floc blanket to stay a constant height while sludge accumulates and consolidates in the floc hopper. Consolidated sludge in the bottom of the floc hopper is then removed from the sedimentation tank through small drain valve controlled by the operator. Floc hoppers are currently set at a 45 degree angle, but there further optimization is needed.</p>
<p>The floc hopper allows for a self-cleaning sedimentation tank. By gravity, flocs are sent over to a floc hopper. This means that operators only have to clean the sedimentation tank once every three to six months because there is no stagnant accumulation of anoxic sludge. When operators do clean the sedimentation tank, they are primarily cleaning plate settlers. Under normal operation, operators can open the floc hopper drain valve whenever they want to easily drain the sludge. We don’t yet have a method to guide the operation of the floc hopper, so operators determine how frequently to drain the floc hopper from experimental and operational experience. Without the floc blanket transport system, other methods would be required to remove accumulated sludge in the bay. Mechanical sludge removal systems are common alternatives but are well known to be costly to install and a challenge to maintain.</p>
<p>We’ve stated that a benefit of the floc blanket is that flocs can be removed without mechanical assistance, but why do we need the floc hopper at all? Why can’t we just install drain holes in the bottom of the sedimentation tank so that any accumulated sludge is removed? This is a question that plagued AguaClara in its early years. At first, before we were able to successfully build and operate a floc blanket, we had sludge accumulate in the bottom of the sedimentation bay. Therefore, we needed to remove the sludge with drain holes at the bottom. However, to have those drain holes where the sludge was accumulating in the tank, designers made a flat bottom tank. But as we now know, the flat bottom tank is part of the reason that there wasn’t any floc blanket forming. As soon as we realized that we could grow a floc blanket with a sloped bottom tank and a jet reverser, we could not use drain holes in the bottom of the tank. Why? Because in the bottom of tanks with floc blankets created by jet reversers, there is no settling. Drain holes at the bottom of a sloped tank would be draining a combination of flocculated water and floc blanket water, neither of which are consolidated thus making the draining ineffective and inefficient. A benefit of the floc hopper is that there is no upflow velocity, which means that the sludge is able to settle and become more dense, allowing for less water waste from draining sludge.</p>
<p>Floc blanket flow into the floc hopper is a function of the mass flux of particles into the sedimentation tank. In order to optimize the floc hopper design, we need to characterize the consolidation rate of the flocs. We do not have a good model for this yet; developing one would allow us to optimize design and guide operators for how much and how frequently the floc hopper should be drained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plate-settlers">
<h3>Plate Settlers<a class="headerlink" href="#plate-settlers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After flowing through the floc blanket, flocs reach the <strong>plate settlers</strong>. Plate settlers are sloped surfaces that provide additional settling area for flocs, thereby increasing the effective settling area of the sedimentation unit without increasing the plan view area. AguaClara plate settlers are sloped at 60 degrees. In our discussion of horizontal and vertical flow sedimentation tanks, an important design parameter was capture velocity which was set by flow rate and plan view area of the sedimentation tank. With the introduction of plate settlers, the important design parameter changes. What matters is not just the plan view area of the sedimentation tank, but instead the projected area of all of the surfaces where particles can settle out, which we call the effective settling area. Without plate settlers, the only way we could improve performance and impact the capture velocity was by increasing the plan view area of the sedimentation tank. With plate settlers, we can improve performance by adding additional settling area without increasing the plan view area. This allows for greater treatment efficiency at low cost because we can maintain a small footprint. Note that plate settlers can also be referred to as lamella settlers, or lamellas.</p>
<p>[[need information about laminar flow between plates]]</p>
<p>[[[[include figure for plate settler and labeled geometry]]]]</p>
<p>The first thing that we will discuss is how flocs can settle on plates. To understand this, we will ask a few questions about how particles and flocs will flow between two plate settlers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What is the critical path?</li>
</ol>
<p>We need particles to settle on the bottom plate for it to be effectively captured. Thus, the critical path can be shown by a floc that enters the plate settlers closest to the upper plate, because it will have the greatest distance to settle.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>How far must the particle settle to reach the lower plate?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s make a simplification and assume that water is flowing with uniform velocity between the plates, represented by a “top hat” velocity profile. This is a significant assumption, but it is used to help us understand the critical path. The fluid is carrying the floc between the inclined plates while gravity is pulling the floc down. Therefore, a particle must fall the vertical distance between the plates, which is the critical height, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c\)</span>. The plates are positioned at an angle, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>, to ensure that settling flocs slide down to the floc blanket. The critical height <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c\)</span> can be expressed in terms of plate settler length, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>, and plate settler angle, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>, by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c=\frac{S}{cos\alpha}\)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>What is the total vertical distance that the critical particle will travel?</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking the vertical component of the critical path, we see that the total vertical distance is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H =L sin\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>What is the net vertical velocity of a floc between the plate settlers?</li>
</ol>
<p>The fluid carries the floc between the plate settlers while gravity pulls the floc down. The velocity through the plate settlers has both a horizontal component, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,H}\)</span>, and vertical component, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V}\)</span>, with a resultant force we call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{\alpha}\)</span>. This means that the net vertical velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,net}\)</span> is the vertical component of flow minus the settling velocity of the floc. Recall our previous discussion of terminal velocity and capture velocity; in this case, because we are designing a plate settler specifically to capture the critical particle, the terminal velocity equals the capture velocity. The terminal velocity is a function of the velocity that the critical particle settles at and the capture velocity is a function of the reactor geometry which we are designing to capture the critical particle. Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,net}=v_{P,V}-v_{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p>From answering the questions above, we know that the particle must fall the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c\)</span> at its terminal velocity in the same amount of time that it rises a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> at its net upward velocity, because otherwise it would not be captured; time to travel <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_c\)</span> = time to travel <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span></p>

<p>[[[[include figure showing the relevant velocities in the plate settler, including resultant particle velocity]]]]</p>
<p>Now that we have established how flocs settle on the plate and the increase in plan view area that plate settlers offer, we need to discuss how flocs will act once they are on the plates. We want particles and flocs that settle to agglomerate and slide down the plate settlers to be returned to the floc blanket. We will explore this concept by first considering the desired spacing between plate settlers.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a basic question. If we know that adding plate settlers improves performance, why don’t we just keep adding more and more plate settlers to our system? Is there any impact of placing plates closer together?</p>
<p>We know that more plates means more effective settling area which means that we could remover more particles and make our tank smaller to save money and limit the use of concrete. But how close can those plates be?</p>
<p>The Ten State Standards report that plate settlers should have a separation of two inches, with very long plate settlers, which means very deep tanks. Sedimentation tanks are usually 4 meters deep, maybe because filters are also deep. This is a result of the engineering context rather than the basic design principles. The Ten State Standards are primarily based off the modification of existing sedimentation tanks which were usually built deep and then plate settlers were added. This means that there wasn’t added incentive to optimize the entire plate settler and tank process because the tanks were already built. However, AguaClara designs are made to use all of the AguaClara innovations in a green field, meaning that we are incentivized to optimize every part of this design process [[weird way to say this…reword]].</p>
<p>AguaClara plants can design for changes in the depth and/or plan view area of the tank for optimal plate settler efficiency. We want to have the smallest and shallowest tanks possible for low cost and ease of construction. We know that in the plate settler design, there is a dimensionless parameter of plate spacing to length, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{S}{L}\)</span>. The ratio is close to constant, which means that if we double the length of the plate settler, we can double the spacing between the plate settler and get the same performance as when we started. Conversely, if we halve the distance between the plate settlers, we can halve the length of the plate settlers. But how far can we push this? Can we make really compact plate settlers?</p>
<p>What we really want to know is: what is the connection of spacing between plate settlers and performance?</p>
<p>[[[[show graphic of large spacing and small spacing with floc rollup]]]]</p>
<p>When we were discussed how plate settlers promote settling, we assumed a uniform velocity profile between the plates. However, we know from fluid mechanics and boundary layer rules that in reality, there is a nonuniform velocity profile. The flow between the plates, as determined by the Reynolds number, is laminar which means that there is a parabolic velocity profile between the plates and the shape of the parabola is affected by the distance between the plates.</p>
<p>There are some cases in which the plates are so close that even if flocs settle on the plate, they do not slide down. This is called <strong>floc rollup</strong>. Consider the following questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Why would flocs roll up?</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a force balance! There is a force of gravity pulling the particle down, balanced with the force that the fluid flow exerts through drag related to viscosity. But why does it matter if plates are close together for floc roll up? The average velocity between plates is about 1 mm/s and is the same for any spacing. However, when plates are closer together the velocity profile is much steeper. Compared with plates with greater spacing, the closer plates cause there to be a higher velocity closer to the surface of the plate. This means that flocs between closely spaced plates will see a greater velocity closer to the plate settler, which will impact the force balance. The derivation of the force balance is done in the next chapter. The velocity that the flocs slide down the plate is called <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{Slide}\)</span>.</p>
<p>[[[[force balance diagram]]]]</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>How would you define the transition between floc rollup and slide down? What would describe the case for a floc that is stationary on the plate settler (not rolling up or sliding down?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The transition is defined as when the gravitational forces and the fluid drag forces match.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Will little flocs or big flocs be most vulnerable to floc rollup?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very complicated question. We would expect big flocs to slide down because they are heavier and have a greater gravitational force. However, bigger flocs also have a greater drag force and are out further into the flow. Because of the velocity profile, they will feel a higher velocity than smaller flocs. This means that the answer to this question should be determine mathematically, which it is in the next section.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Will large or small spacing between plates cause more floc rollup?</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have already suggested, small spacing between plates will cause more floc rollup due to the steeper resulting velocity profile between the plates.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for plate settler spacing? Let’s review some results from lab experiments. The following graph shows minimum plate settler spacing (mm) as a function of floc terminal velocity (mm/s). Some important things to note are that AguaClara plate settlers are designed for a capture velocity of 0.12 mm/s (recall that this capture velocity means that we want to capture flocs that are settling at 0.12 mm/s and faster). Before AguaClara filters were designed and deployed, AguaClara adopted the 0.12 mm/s capture velocity in an effort to reduce effluent turbidity as much as possible.</p>
<p>Reading the graph, we can see the line for 1 mm/s upflow velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V}\)</span> [[I don’t think this is the right variable name]], at 0.12 mm/s capture velocity requires a minimum plate spacing of about about 2.5 mm to prevent floc rollup. Now, let’s interpret this result. If the upflow velocity increases, we see that the required spacing between plates increases. The results from these experiments will help us answer one of our previous questions: will little flocs or big flocs be most vulnerable to floc rollup? From the graph, we know that it is the little ones. Smaller floc terminal velocities indicate smaller particles, and the graph shows that smaller floc terminal velocities require larger distances of floc spacing to not roll up. The bigger the flocs, the smaller the spacing required to not roll up. Little flocs are harder to capture as you move plates closer together. Little flocs roll up first.</p>
<p>[[[[plot of minimum plate spacing, function of floc Vt]]]]</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that the Standard design is nowhere near the constraint of floc roll up (recall that Standard design reports separations of 5 cm). AguaClara plate settlers are currently using separations of 2.5 cm, which is also far above the constraint of floc roll up. So if we determined that the minimum spacing for floc roll up constraints is closer to 2.5 mm, why are we using 2.5 cm? The answer is related to our initial assumptions about the floc composition and terminal velocity. When we calculated terminal velocities, we did so for clay-based flocs. But in reality, there are many kinds of flocs formed in water treatment plants. Dissolved organic matter also interacts with coagulant to form flocs that we assume are much less dense than clay based flocs. We don’t currently have a good model to understand how these organic-matter flocs. We don’t know what the terminal velocity of flocs is if they are made of organics, coagulant, and clay. But even without knowing specifics, how do we think minimum plate spacing will be impacted by flocs that are formed from organic matter instead of clay? If we use dissolved organic matter, the equation predicts that spacing will change primarily due to the big difference in floc density. As floc density decreases, as we expect for organic matter, minimum spacing increases. However, we don’t yet know what that spacing is or where the boundary is because we don’t know the properties of the humic acid-coagulant flocs. This prompts us to opt for safety factors, so we have chosen a plate settler spacing of 2.5 cm. There is room to learn more here.</p>
<p>Why does the plate settling distance matter so much? How much does it impact the rest of the sedimentation tank and its design?</p>
<p>One impact of plate settler spacing is on sedimentation tank depth. We know that the spacing between plate settlers has a strong influence on sedimentation tank depth and closer plate settlers allows for shallower tanks. There is a diminishing effect for small spacings, meaning that the difference in depth between 5 and 2.5 cm spacing is greater than the different in depth between 2.5 and 1 cm spacing. Because AguaClara does not yet have a good model for non-clay flocs, we cannot optimize our plate settler spacing and thus cannot optimize for the shallowest tanks possible.</p>
<p>Another impact of plate settler spacing is on flow distribution in the tank. This is related to our previous discussion of pressure recovery and flow distribution. Reduced spacing between plates leads to an increased pressure drop through the plate settlers due to higher head loss. Therefore, plate settlers with small spacing will have more uniform flow distributions because head loss will dominate. The pressure difference between one plate settler and the next would be very small compared to the pressure difference between the bottom of the plate settlers and the top of the plate settlers. This use of head loss can potentially get us better flow distribution. When the plates are brought closer together, there is more shear between the plates because the average velocity remains the same. The velocity gradient is higher between closer plates, which leads to higher shear, and thus higher head loss.</p>
<p>However, if the plates are closer together, then they will be shorter in length to keep the capture velocity constant. The decrease in length decreases the total amount of shear. The head loss from the competing impacts to shear can be determined through a force balance and the Navier-Stokes equation, as shown in the derivations section [[[[link and plot]]]]. The important thing to note is that after determining head loss as a function of plate settler spacing, we realize that the plate settlers do not provide much head loss at the design separation of 2.5 cm. Head loss through plate settlers is really small, which means that they do not contribute much to equalizing flow distribution. So, is this head loss “good” or “bad”? It is neither because it is so small that it is negligible in our overall system.</p>
<p>The velocities of any eddies or mean flow need to be less than 4 mm/s to achieve uniform flow through plate settlers. This means that if there is any flow entering the plate settlers at greater than 4 mm/s, the head loss provided by the plate settlers will not help at all to dampen the nonuniformity and there will not be adequate flow distribution. Luckily for us, the upflow velocity through the sedimentation tank is on average 1 mm/s, which fulfills the requirement of less than 4 mm/s. However, remember the diffusers that distribute water into the sedimentation tank? They create velocities on the order of 100s of mm/s [[help]]. Those high initial velocities are damped out by the floc blanket which helps to distribute the flow. If we weren’t able to use the floc blanket to dampen the flow to be less than 4 mm/s, then the plate settlers would not provide any head loss to help with uniform flow distribution. This point about uniform flow is really important.</p>
<p>Now, lets discuss a plate settler problem that has not yet been solved: <strong>floc volcanoes</strong>. Floc volcanoes occur when water and flocs rise preferentially in one part of the sedimentation tank. At points of high velocity, flocs can rise to the surface of the water. Consider the following case: an AguaClara plant in San Nicolas, Honduras, was witnessing intermittent floc volcanoes in the sedimentation tanks. During operation, the plant was treating raw water with 4 NTU with a PACl dose of 3.5 mg/L. The settled water turbidity varied between 0.5 and 4 NTU. What might explain the floc volcanoes and very poor plant performance? Try coming up with a hypothesis that matches the information given to us from the plant. We want to figure out what is causing this problem so we can design a solution. What questions would you want to ask the technicians or engineers in Honduras? This exercise emphasizes the idea that asking the right questions are sometimes the hardest first step to learning more information.</p>
<p>Some hypotheses and questions may include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>is the problem related to dissolved air flotation? Dissolved air coming out of flocculation can cause flocs to float to the top.</li>
</ol>
<p>After asking the operators, we are told that there are not any bubbles in the sedimentation tank.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>is the problem regularly intermittent? Is there anything that we can correlate these fluctuations to?</li>
</ol>
<p>After asking the operators, we are told that the floc volcanoes appear in the early afternoon each day. Using this new information, we have to make another hypothesis about why the floc volcanoes are impacted daily. Perhaps it is related to the sun and daily temperature changes. We can ask the operators to measure the water temperatures so we can do some analysis. The operators measure temperature and we plot the results, providing the following graph.</p>
<p>We know that this plant brings water from a water source about 14 km away. The water is transported in a galvanized iron pipe that is placed on the surface of the ground because there is no concern about freezing pipes in Honduras (galvanized iron is not damaged by UV like PVC pipe is). The pipe functions as a 14 km water heater, raising the temperature of the water to the plant after noon.</p>
<p>But why does the temperature difference cause a problem for the plate settlers?
The problem is that there is warmer water entering the sedimentation tank than what is in it. This temperature difference causes a density difference in the sedimentation tank and plate settlers. The less dense, warmer water rises to the top of the plate settlers while the cold water drops to the bottom of the plate. This creates a current, allowing water to flow up on the top and settle on the bottom. The temperature gradient changes slowly over a few hours.</p>
<p>So, now that we think we know what the problem is, how would we try to solve it? One idea would be to paint the entire line to reflect heat, but this is not feasible due to cost. The town Water Board had been maintaining the distribution line by cleaning weeds and brush from the pipe. The solution ended up being to just let the weeds grow over the pipe to provide shade. We haven’t yet come up with a real solution. A possible long-term solution could be to design a sedimentation tank that has a really short residence time. The longer the residence time in the sedimentation tank, the worse the problem is because there is a large variation between the water that entered it last night and the water that enters it this afternoon. A tank with a really short residence time, on the order of a few minutes, would ensure that the water coming in would be very close to the water already in the tank.</p>
<p>Let’s recap some important conclusions from this section on plate settlers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Reynolds number calculations of flow through plate settlers prove that there is laminar flow between plate settlers. This is important because it allows us to assume that a parabolic velocity profile is established.</li>
<li>There is very low head loss between plate settlers so they will not do a good job of helping to achieve uniform flow between the plate settlers.</li>
<li>The plate settlers are designed to capture flocs with sedimentation velocities greater than the settle capture velocity. AguaClara currently uses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_c = 0.12\)</span> mm/s but this value needs to be further optimized; we would like to know how settled water turbidity changes with capture velocity. Future work includes choosing a settle capture velocity based on overall plate performance.</li>
<li>Plate settler spacing:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>Plate settler spacing determines the ability of flocs to roll down the incline.</li>
<li>Smaller spacings between plate setters have diminishing returns in terms of sedimentation tank depth. The current AguaClara spacing is 2.5 cm but there is room for further optimization.</li>
<li>Flocs made from natural organic matter (NOM) may be less dense, more prone to floc rollup, and may require larger spacing between plate settlers.</li>

<h2>3) How water leaves the sedimentation tank<a class="headerlink" href="#how-water-leaves-the-sedimentation-tank" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have passed through the plate settlers, we are ready to leave the sedimentation tank.</p>
<div class="section" id="submerged-effluent-manifold">
<h3>Submerged Effluent Manifold<a class="headerlink" href="#submerged-effluent-manifold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>submerged effluent manifold</strong>, sometimes called a launder, collects settled water from the sedimentation tank. It is a horizontal pipe that extends along the length of the tank and is located above the plate settlers but below the surface of the water. The submerged pipe has orifices drilled into its top; water enters the pipe through the orifices and the pipe leads out of the sedimentation tank. Recall that the influent manifold also uses a submerged pipe and orifice design to distribute flow. However, unlike the influent manifold, the effluent manifold does not include diffusers because we do not need to precisely control velocity and flow direction.</p>
<p>The orifices in the pipe are evenly distributed along the length of the pipe to promote even flow collection from the tank. The orifices are designed create uniform head loss. Is this head loss “good” or “bad”? Like the diffusers, the orifices in the effluent manifold create “good” head loss because they increase head loss through all flow paths. This is critical because there is pressure recovery within the effluent manifold that creates “bad” head loss.</p>
<p>Are there effluent manifold exit losses? What type of head loss would it be? This head loss is a result of exit loss into its receiving channel. Is it “good” or “bad”? This head loss is also “good” head loss because it impacts all flow paths the same; each sedimentation tank bay and all water within a single bay is subject to the same amount of exit loss.</p>
<p>Why did AguaClara design the effluent manifold to be submerged? It is designed to be submerged because sometimes there are particles or substances that rise to the top of sedimentation tanks and float on the water surface. These particles or substances may be flocs that escaped capture and remain buoyant, or may be foam or scum that results from organic matter in the water. No matter what it is that is rising to the water surface, we want to avoid it entering the settled water effluent pipe. Placing the effluent manifold below the surface allows particles or substances floating on the surface to remain separate from the effluent water headed towards filtration. Operators can then skim the water surface to remove and dispose of anything that floats.</p>
<p>Why are the orifices in the effluent manifold located at the top of the pipe?
They are located on the top to promote even flow collection and for ease of operation and maintenance. The orifices need to be either located on the top or bottom so that they are symmetrical about the tank because if the orifices were put on the sides, then they might not draw water evenly from the entire tank. So, we are to choose between the top or the bottom; which would be better for operation and maintenance? The top is better because orifices located on the top of the pipe can be easily observed and maintained by operators in case any clogging occurs. We also want to limit the number of flocs that rise through the plate settlers and enter the effluent manifold. Locating the orifices on the top discourages that from happening by not drawing up directly from the top of plate settlers and by giving more time for flocs to potentially settle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exit-weir-and-effluent-channel">
<h3>Exit Weir and Effluent Channel<a class="headerlink" href="#exit-weir-and-effluent-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The submerged effluent manifold transports water from the sedimentation tank to a channel that runs perpendicular to the sedimentation bays. The channel collects water from all of the sedimentation bays. Water leaves this channel by flowing over a small wall, called the <strong>exit weir</strong>. The exit weir is used as a flow control device because it is the free-fall that controls water levels all the way upstream to the previous free-fall, which was the LFOM. So, the height of the exit weir is critical to ensuring appropriate water levels in the flocculator and sedimentation tank. In construction, great care is taken to ensure that this wall is precise and level.</p>
<p>After the water flows over the exit weir, it is collected in the <strong>effluent channel</strong>. The effluent channel has pipes embedded in the bottom of it which lead the settled water to the filter inlet box. Like the sedimentation tank influent channel, the effluent channel is located directly next to the drain channel. This allows the operator to remove poorly settled water from the treatment train. If an operator observes poor sedimentation, they can plug the entrance hole to the filter box, allowing the effluent channel to fill with water. Once water reaches the height of the wall separating it from the drain channel, the water will pour over from the influent channel into the drain channel.</p>

<h2>Comparison of velocities and flow in sedimentation tank<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-velocities-and-flow-in-sedimentation-tank" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand how water flows in the sedimentation tank, we must understand how the water velocity changes with the geometry. There are four distinct zones in the sedimentation tank: 1) the velocity of water exiting the diffusers, 2) the velocity of water moving through the floc blanket, 3) the velocity of water that enters the plate settlers, and 4) the velocity of water through the plate settlers. The geometry of the sedimentation tank changes in these four zones, so we will follow these changes to make sure that we understand the conservation of flow. The flow going through the sedimentation tank is the same everywhere, but average velocities are different.

<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SedActive} =\)</span> length of the sedimentation tank that includes entrance to a plate settlers</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{A,V} =\)</span> upflow velocity of the water entering the plate settlers; vertical velocity in ‘active’ region</div>
</div>
<p>The only reason that there is a distinction between this area and the floc blanket area is because plate settlers are built at an angle. This angle creates a “lost triangle” because there is a space in which the plate settlers are not effective and water does not flow through them. Because the active length is less than the floc blanket length, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SedActive} &lt; L_{SedFloc}\)</span>, and because flow must be conserved, the average active velocity must be greater than the average upflow velocity through the floc blanket, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{A,V} &gt; v_{S,V}\)</span>. The same flow going through less area means that the velocity must increase.</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Sed} = W_{Sed}*L_{SedActive}*v_{A,V}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{A,V} &gt; v_{S,V}\)</span>.</p>

<h3>4) Velocity and flow in the plate settlers<a class="headerlink" href="#velocity-and-flow-in-the-plate-settlers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now, we will discuss flow through plate settlers where:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V} =\)</span> upflow velocity of the water in the plate settlers; vertical velocity component between the plate settlers</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S =\)</span> spacing between plate settlers</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B =\)</span> center-to-center distance between plate settlers</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T =\)</span> thickness of plate settlers</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L =\)</span> length of plate settlers</div>
</div>
<p>We know that plate settlers have a certain thickness and take up area, which means that once we reach the plate settler zone, there is less area for water to travel through. Because flow is conserved and there is a decrease in area, we know that the upflow velocity of water through the plate settlers must increase compared to the upflow velocity of water below the plate settlers, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V} &gt; v_{A,V}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V} &gt; v_{A,V} &gt; v_{S,V}\)</span></p>
<p>In addition to the vertical velocity component increasing between the plates, the resultant velocity of water between the plates increases compared to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{A,V}\)</span>. What are the two reasons that this is true?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the first reason, as already discussed, is that the vertical velocity component needs to increase to ensure conservation of flow.</li>
<li>the second reason has to do with the fact that the resultant velocity of water between the plates is at an angle. This means that there is a horizontal component introduced. Because we know that the vertical velocity increases, and there is a new positive horizontal velocity component, the resultant velocity must also increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, consider a tube settler used in a lab setting instead of a plate settler. If a tube settler was designed with an angle to mimic a plate settler, would the water change vertical velocity after the angle? How does this compare to the plate settler scenario? In the case of the tube settler, the vertical velocity does not increase because there is no change in flow area; the diameter of the tube is constant throughout, meaning that for the flow to remain constant, the velocity does not change.</p>
<p>For another example of flow conservation, let’s consider the relationship between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V}*S\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{A,V}*B\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is the center-to-center distance between plate settlers, and does not take into account the thickness of plate settlers. Considering only the center-to-center distance means that the area for water to travel through does to change from before the plate settlers to within the plate settlers because we are not accounting for any thickness. If the area does not change, then velocity should also not change to keep flow conserved. However, if we are to account for thickness, we must discuss <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> which is the spacing between plate settlers. This does take into account the change in area,  which means that the velocity would need to increase through the lesser area. So if we look at the flow through plate settlers, we can confirm that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V}*S = v_{A,V}*B\)</span>.</p>
<p>By using flow conservation and plate settler geometry, we can begin to understand the mathematical relationships that drive design.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the relationships that we already know:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V}*S = v_{A,V}*B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B = S+T\)</span></p>

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{P,V} = \frac{v_{A,V}*(S+T)}{S}\)</span></p>

<p>As has been discussed, floc rollup is a failure mode of plate settler performance [[link]]. To determine the appropriate spacing between plate settlers, we must consider the potential for flocs to rollup because we want to minimize rollup and promote settling.

<h3>Head Loss through Plate Settlers<a class="headerlink" href="#head-loss-through-plate-settlers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flow through the sedimentation tank is controlled by head loss in an attempt to achieve flow uniformity. We have already explained that plate settler spacing impacts head loss [[[[link]]]], but by what mathematical relationship? Will putting plate settlers closer together result in more or less head loss? This question is complicated because closer plate settlers would create more shear and head loss, but shorter plate settlers also mean that they become shorter which would decrease shear and head loss.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a force balance. Assume that there is a fully established velocity profile that is parabolic with laminar flow. The forces that we care about are shear forces on the walls of the plate settlers and the differential pressure from flow in the direction of the velocity. [[[[figure]]]]</p>
<p>The shear forces act over the area of the two plates, resulting in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{shear} = 2 \tau L W\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is the viscous shear component.</p>
<p>The pressure force is exerted over the entire width of the plate and the plate spacing. Pressure at the entrance of the plate settlers is different from the exit of the plate settlers by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta P\)</span>. The resulting pressure force is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F_{pressure} = \Delta P W S\)</span>. So,</p>

<h3>Floc Blanket Collision Potential<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-blanket-collision-potential" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have learned that growing a floc blanket leads to better sedimentation tank performance. One explanation for the improved performance is that the floc blanket acts like an additional flocculator because there are additional collisions between particles. To understand the nature and significance of these additional collisions, we can calculate the floc blanket velocity gradients and residence time to find collision potential, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span>. In a floc blanket, we expect that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> is small; however, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> is large, which means that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> in the floc blanket may be significant.</p>
<p>First, we will find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. If we simplify the bottom of the sedimentation tank and approximate it as a simple rectangle, we can easily determine the residence time. If the depth of the floc blanket is 1 m and the upflow velocity is 1 mm/s, we determine that</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta = 1000 s\)</span></p>
<p>Next, we will find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>. Before we begin, consider why there is a velocity gradient in the floc blanket. What causes it? Water is flowing up through the floc blanket while the flocs in the floc blanket are being pulled down by gravity. The differential velocities are caused by particles settling and rising at different velocities relative to the fluid due to drag, gravity, and fluid flow. In the fluid around each particle, there is a velocity gradient and shear between the particles and the surrounding fluid.</p>
<p>Entering the sedimentation tank, there is a large range of particle sizes in the water. The range exists from big flocs made up with hundreds of millions of clay particles to primary particles that made it through flocculation without successful collision. These differentially sized particles create velocity gradients as the particles and flocs are acted on by both settling forces and upward fluid flow forces.</p>
<p>Large flocs provide velocity gradients that can potentially cause collisions between other small particles that we are still trying to capture. Through our derivation to determine <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> in a floc blanket, we will also test an assumption. We will assume that primary particles coming into the floc blanket are not interacting with large flocs. Instead,  we will assume that the the fluid shear and differential velocities promote interactions between two primary particles.</p>
<p>So, how can we calculate the velocity gradient? In flocculators, we determined <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> from head loss and residence time. In sedimentation tanks, we determine <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> the same way. Let’s calculate the head loss through the floc blanket. To do this, we need to know the density of the floc blanket and we need to know the relationship between head loss a fluidized bed and density of the bed.</p>

<h4>Floc blanket density<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-blanket-density" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To calculate the density of the floc blanket at steady-state, we will use principles of mass and volume conservation.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{clay} = \frac{m_{clay}}{\rlap{-}V_{fb}}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho = \frac{m_{TOT}}{\rlap{-}V}\)</span></p>
<p>We will start by finding the mass of clay and the mass of water in the floc blanket, where:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{clay} =\)</span> concentration of clay in the floc blanket</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rlap{-}V_{fb} =\)</span> volume of floc blanket</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{clay} =\)</span> density of clay</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{H_2O} =\)</span> density of water</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{fb} =\)</span> density of floc blanket</div>
</div>
<p>The mass of clay in the floc blanket is concentration multiplied by volume, shown by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_{clay} = C_{clay}\rlap{-}V_{fb}\)</span></p>
<p>The mass of water in the floc blanket is related to the volume fraction of the floc blanket that is occupied by clay, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{C_{clay}}{\rho_{clay}}\)</span>, whic is a very small number. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( 1 - \frac{C_{clay}}{\rho_{clay}} \right)\)</span> is the fraction of the floc blanket that is occupied by water, also called the water volume fraction. So, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_{H_2O} = \left( 1 - \frac{C_{clay}}{\rho_{clay}} \right) \rho_{H_2O} \rlap{-}V_{fb}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, we know how much clay and water is in our system. The density of the system, neglecting the addition of coagulant, is,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{fb} = \frac{m_{clay} + m_{H_2O}}{\rlap{-}V_{fb}}\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Substituting for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_{clay}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m_{H_2O}\)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{fb} = \left( 1 - \frac{C_{clay}}{\rho_{clay}} \right)\rho_{H_2O} + C_{clay}\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>This can be rearranged to yield the following equation derived from first principles,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{fb} = \left( 1 - \frac{\rho_{H_2O}}{\rho_{clay}} \right)C_{clay} + \rho_{H_2O}\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>AguaClara researchers in the lab developed an empirical equation through experimental studies to calculate floc blanket density. They determined that,</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{fb} = 0.687C_{clay} + \rho_{H_2O}\)</span></p>
<p>Comparing the empirical equation to the one determined by first principles, it clear that the coefficient,</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( 1 - \frac{\rho_{H_2O}}{\rho_{clay}} \right) = 0.687\)</span></p>

<h4>Floc blanket head loss<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-blanket-head-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now that we can calculate the density of the floc blanket, we can calculate the head loss through the floc blanket. This topic will be discussed further in the chapter on filtration. For now, all you need to know is that density can be related to head loss in the floc blanket through the height of the floc blanket, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{fb}\)</span>, and the densities of the floc blanket and water.</p>
<p>:math:<a href="#id27"><span class="problematic" id="id28">`</span></a>frac{h_L}{H_{fb}} = frac{rho_{fb} - rho_{H_2O}}{rho_{H_2O}} `</p>

<h4>Floc blanket velocity gradient and collision potential<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-blanket-velocity-gradient-and-collision-potential" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>With the equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L\)</span>, we can calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>. We will also use the other equations we developed in the chapter on flocculation [[[[link]]]].</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = \frac{gh_L}{\theta}\)</span></p>

<p>We will start by determining <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon ` by calculating :math:\)</span>theta` using the porosity of the floc blanket, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_{fb}\)</span>,</p>

<blockquote>
<div><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon = \frac{gv_{S,V}}{\phi_{fb}} \frac{h_L}{H_{fb}}\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Substituting into our equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<div>:math:` G =  sqrt{frac{gv_{S,V}}{nu phi_{fb}} frac{h_L}{H_{fb}}}`</div></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<div><p>:math:` G =  sqrt{frac{gv_{S,V}}{nu phi_{fb}} left( frac{1}{rho_{H_2O}} - frac{1}{rho_{clay}} right) C_{clay} }`</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi_{fb} \approx 1\)</span> and is a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{clay}\)</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We can plot our results for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> over a range of typical floc blanket concentrations, which is around 1 - 5 g/L. [[[[plot]]]] We find that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> ranges from 2 to 6 Hz. Recall that for flocculator design, we get anywhere from 70 to several hundred Hz. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> provided by the floc blanket is much smaller than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> provided by the flocculator. This is an important point because in the low <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> environment of the floc blanket where there are low levels of energy dissipation, we can grow larger flocs. The flocs are experiencing less shear so they can grow close to millimeter size.</p>
<p>We can plot our results for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> by multiplying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> by the residence time we found earlier, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta = 1000 s\)</span>. The result is that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> ranges from 2,000 to 6,000. Compare this to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta = 20,000\)</span> for the flocculator used in experiments [[[[Garland]]]].</p>
<p>How does such a small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> cause such a large reduction in turbidity? The question we are really asking is, is there anything special about the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> provided by the floc blanket compared to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> provided by the flocculator? If so, what is the difference and why is it so beneficial?</p>
<p>Experimental data helps explain this. Two systems were set up: one had a flocculator where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta = 20,000\)</span> with a floc blanket where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta = 4,000\)</span>; the other just had a flocculator where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta = 24,000\)</span>. Using the same influent water quality and coagulant dosing, we find that the first system with the flocculator and floc blanket performed better than the second system, even though the overall <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\theta\)</span> values were the same.</p>
<p>To understand this, we have to review assumptions in the derivation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>. Recall our assumption that fluid shear promotes the collision of two primary particles instead of the collision of primary particles with existing, large flocs. If our assumption was true, we would expect to see no difference between our two experimental setups. However, because we know that the two experimental setups did have different results, our assumption must be false because the assumption does not explain or account for these differences. There must be another mechanism occuring to explain why the floc blanket greatly improves treatment quality. This leads us to believe that the flocs in the floc blanket must be more involved than simply providing shear and velocity gradients; they must be involved in some collisions with the small particles coming through the floc blanket.</p>
<p>This highlights an important distinction:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The model created by the original derivation assumption would suggests that flocs in the floc blanket are inert - simply occupying space and causing there to be head loss in the floc blanket - without being involved in any collisions. This model is disproved through the experimental analysis of the two experimental setups.</li>
<li>The model created after the analysis of experimental results suggests that flocs in the floc blanket are not inert - they are involved in collisions with small particles entering the floc blanket - and are growing in size. The model is supported through the experimental analysis.</li>

<h3>Determining flow through a diffuser<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-flow-through-a-diffuser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What is the flow rate of a single diffuser in the bottom of the sedimentation tank? Consider a sedimentation tank that is 6 m long, 1 m wide and 2 m deep, with an upflow velocity of 1 mm/s and a diffuser spacing of 5 cm.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What is this question really asking? This question is asking us to understand that each diffuser “serves” a specific cross-sectional area of the sedimentation tank; all of the diffusers together serve the entire area of the sedimentation tank. So, let’s imagine a single diffuser serving a slice of a sedimentation tank. With this in mind, we can easily solve this using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q = vA\)</span>. The area, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, is the slice of the sedimentation tank that we are serving. We are told that the tank is 1 m wide, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{tank} = 1\)</span> m. The length of the slice is dictated by the spacing of the diffusers, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_{diff}\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_{diff} = 5\)</span> cm.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A = B_{diff}W_{tank}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A = 5cm * 1m\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A = 50,000mm^2\)</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The problem statement includes that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{S,V} = 1\)</span> mm/s. Plugging into our flow equation,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>:math:<a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">`</span></a>Q_{diff} = v_{S,V}A `</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{diff} = (1 \frac{mm}{s})(50,000mm^2)\)</span></p>

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{diff} = 50 \frac{mL}{s}\)</span></p>

<div class="section" id="properties-of">
<h3>Properties of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet}\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet}\)</span> is defined as the velocity of the water jet exiting the diffuser. After exiting the diffuser, this water jet is sent into the jet reverser to make a 180 degree turn. Does the water jet change pressure or velocity as it exits the jet reverser? Do we need to consider the effects of a <em>vena contracta</em>?</p>
<p>Recall that a <em>vena contracta</em> is associated with a change in pressure that causes a contraction and subsequent acceleration of the fluid [[[[link to fluids review]]]]. Water exiting the diffuser is pointed directly down and the streamlines are straight and parallel, which means that the pressure across the streamlines is constant. Water exiting the jet reverser is pointed directly up and the streamlines are straight and parallel, which again means that the pressure across the streamlines is constant. Because the pressure is constant at the exit of the diffuser and at the exit of the jet reverser, we assume that the pressure of the water in the space between those two points is also constant because there is no physical barrier. If the pressure in this bottom section of the sedimentation tank is constant from the exit of the diffuser to the exit of the jet reverser, we can infer that they are equal.</p>
<p>By Bernoulli, if the pressures between the exit of the diffuser to the exit of the jet reverser are equal then the velocities must also be equal. Bernoulli is applicable here because there is no flow expansion yet. The shear along the wall of the jet reverser is insignificant due to the short flow path. The water accelerates to account for the directional change but the absolute velocity does not change as it goes around the jet reverser.</p>
<p>Therefore, the velocity at the exit of the diffuser is equal to the velocity at the exit of the jet reverser.</p>

<h3>Diffuser Design<a class="headerlink" href="#id31" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What is the target shape of the diffuser? We know that the diffuser must be sized so that our velocity constraints will be achieved. The minimum velocity constraint comes from the need to keep flocs resuspended. We also know that in the active region of our sedimentation tank, we want an upflow velocity of 1 mm/s. Additionally, because diffusers are a key component of our “sedimentation tank as a circuit”, we want to precisely control head loss in the jet leaving the jet reverser because that will help us achieve uniform flow within and between sedimentation tanks. AguaClara designs set head loss in the jet constant at 1 cm.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by finding the internal width of a single diffuser. Using conservation of flow, we know that,</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{diff} = v_{jet}W_{diff}S_{diff} = v_{S,V}W_{Sed}B_{diff}\)</span></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff}\)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff} = \frac{v_{S,V}W_{Sed}B_{diff}}{v_{jet}S_{diff}}\)</span></div></blockquote>
<p>Using the constraint of head loss in the jet and solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet}\)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{L,jet} = \frac{v_{jet}^2}{2g}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet} = \sqrt{2gh_{L,jet}}\)</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Substituting back into the equation for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff}\)</span>, we can find the minimum diffuser width required to not exceed target head loss as,</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff,min} = \frac{v_{S,V}W_{Sed}B_{diff}}{(\sqrt{2gh_{L,jet}})S_{diff}}\)</span></p>
<p>Now that we have determined the minimum width, we can use known parameters and constraints to find a precise value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using known constants for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{S,V} = 1 \frac{mm}{s}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{L,jet} = 1 cm\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{Sed} = 1m\)</span>, we can find that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff,min} = 2.7mm\)</span>. The mold used to create diffusers in Honduras comes in sizes of 1/8 in, or 3.175 mm, so to find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff}\)</span> we round up to 3.175 mm.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{diff} = 3.175 mm\)</span></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet}\)</span> from our earlier equations yields,</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{jet} = \frac{v_{S,V}W_{Sed}B_{diff}}{W_{diff}S_{diff}}\)</span></p>
<p>Using known constants,</p>
