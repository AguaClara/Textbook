<p>To understand how sedimentation works, a few key concepts must first be developed. This includes understanding how and why flocs move in water. Remember, the goal of sedimentation reactor design is to optimize the floc-settling process.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminal-velocity">
<h2>Terminal Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#terminal-velocity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As flocs settle in water, they will fall at a speed dictated by the weight of the floc, the buoyancy of the floc, and drag from the water. These three forces - the gravitational weight force, the buoyant force, and the drag force - dictate the speed at which a floc falls and are detailed in the following free body diagram. We care about determining the speed at which flocs will fall because [WHY].</p>

<p>Terminal velocity is a function of fluid density, floc density, gravity, particle diameter, and the drag coefficient. To calculate velocity, all of those inputs must be determined.</p>
<p>The first component that we will focus on is the drag coefficient, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D\)</span>. The drag coefficient is function of Reynolds Number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span>, and the characteristic flow around a particle. As a reminder, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = \frac{v_t D}{\nu}\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_t\)</span> is the velocity of the fluid, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is the length scale, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> is kinematic viscosity.</p>
<p>Drag coefficients are used to describe flow around a particle.
[INCLUDE FIGURE FOR DRAG COEFFICIENT AND REYNOLDS NUMBER]</p>
<p>As an introduction to this drag coefficent diagram, we can compare it to something we’ve already learned about: the Moody diagram. Drawing parallels between the two will help us understand some important relationships better.</p>
<p>The flow around the particle and the Reynolds Number can be described in the laminar, turbulent, or turbulent-boundary regions. In the laminar region, which holds when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re &lt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = \frac{24}{Re}\)</span>. This region of laminar flow, represented as the straight line on the log-log plot, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = \frac{24}{Re}\)</span> is referred to as Stokes Law. You’ll notice that the line for Stokes Law shown in the figure extends past the laminar region. This was done because it shows that even though Stokes Law is not exactly correct past the turbulent region, it is still a pretty good approximation near <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_D = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the drag coefficient diagram at Reynolds numbers of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^5\)</span>. We notice that there is a “bump” in the plot, in which drag coefficients drop. This is because at really high Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer around the particle became turbulent. This causes the wake behind the particle to be a little smaller, leading to a slight reduction in drag. The drag coefficient decreases, but the total drag force does not necessarily decrease (and likely keeps on increasing).</p>
<p>To understand this phenomenon, think about a golf ball. Golf balls are designed with dimpled surfaces because the dimpled surface forces the transition described above to happen at lower Reynolds numbers. The dimples initiate turbulence in the boundary layer and cause a slight reduction in the drag coefficient. Thus, dimpled golf balls can travel further than smooth ones.</p>
<p>Now, you might think: why aren’t more surfaces dimpled? If I want my car to get better mileage, should I dimple its surface to take advantage of the same turbulent boundary layer properties as the golf ball? But before you go and damage some metal, let’s think. If a car and golf ball are traveling through air at the same speed, what will be their relative Reynolds numbers? We know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = \frac{v_t D}{\nu}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{golfball} &lt;&lt; D_{car}\)</span>. The relative length scales mean that cars have much higher Reynolds numbers than the golf ball. In fact, the Reynolds number for a car is so high that it is already past the point that the boundary layer becomes turbulent. The golf ball needs to be dimpled because its Reynolds numbers are not so large that they will pass the turbulent boundary transition.</p>
<p>Now, let’s go back to the realm of water treatment. We care about drag coefficients and terminal velocities because they help describe how flocs will move in water. Flocs tend to exist in the region between 1&lt; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span> &lt; 10. This region is not perfectly described by Stokes Law, but it is used as an appropriate approximation. We have already solved for the general equation for terminal velocity using the force balance approach. Now, we can solve for a terminal velocity equation specifically in the laminar region.</p>
<p>Plug the drag coefficient and Reynolds numbers for laminar flow into the general terminal velocity equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-sedimentation-sed-design-4">
<span class="eqno">(410)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-sedimentation-sed-design-4" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}v_t = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}\frac{gD}{C_D}\frac{(\rho_{floc}-\rho_{H_2O})}{\rho_{H_2O}}}\\C_D = \frac{24}{Re}\\Re = \frac{v_tD}{\nu}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>to yield,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-sedimentation-sed-design-5">
<span class="eqno">(411)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-sedimentation-sed-design-5" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[v_t = \frac{D^2g}{18\nu}\frac{\rho_{floc} -\rho_{H2O}}{\rho_{H2O}}\]</div>
<p>Again, we can draw a parallel with the Moody Diagram. The general form of the terminal velocity equation is like the Darcy-Weisbach equation; it is always true. The terminal velocity in the laminar flow region is like the Hagen-Poiselle equation; it is only good for laminar flow. We will use the laminar specific condition because we are working with flocs with low Reynolds numbers.</p>
<p>Our equations for terminal velocity depend on the density of a floc. As discussed in previous sections, we know that there is a specific relationship between the density of a floc and the diameter of a floc because flocs are fractals and as flocs get bigger, their density gets lower. We can account for the size and density relationship by modifying the terminal velocity equation. [[[[MORE INFO NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IN THE FLOCCULATION SECTION]]]]</p>

<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D =\)</span> floc diameter (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>)</div>
</div>
<p>The following plot shows the relationship between floc diameter and terminal velocity.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[INCLUDE FIGURE]]]]]]]]]]]</p>
<p>Three important regions are highlighted in the plot. At small floc diameters, less than 10 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, terminal velocity is less that 0.1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. A terminal velocity this low would require extremely large sedimentation tanks for reasonable treatment. Because large sedimentation tanks are costly and unfeasible, we use flocculation to aggregate particles and achieve floc sizes of greater diameters and higher terminal velocities.</p>
<p>For floc diameters around 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, the terminal velocity is about 1.2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. AguaClara plate settlers are designed to settle out flocs of this size (particles dropping at 1.2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>) so the smallest floc that we can capture is 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>. This will be explored in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>Flocs with large diameters around 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> have a terminal velocity of about 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. In our sedimentation tanks, which are upflow sedimentation tanks, we have water flowing up at about 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span> to capture a 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> floc. These flocs are clearly visible but are small. This is what we design our sedimentation tanks to be able to capture. This will be explored in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>Our understanding of floc terminal velocity suggests that we can decide the size of the floc that we want our sedimentation tank to capture. If we decide that we want to capture flocs that are 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> or larger, we know that we must design for water flowing at 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>. Alternatively, we know that if we design a reactor in which water flows at 1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{mm}{s}\)</span>, we will only be able to capture flocs that are 200 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> or larger. This begins our discussion of sedimentation tank design.</p>

<h2>Capture Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#capture-velocity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Settle capture velocity is defined as the velocity of the slowest settling particle that a sedimentation tank captures reliably. It is a property of the geometry of the sedimentation tank. Because it is a property of geometry, we can use it as an important design tool; because we can control reactor geometry, we can control the sizes of particles that we can settle.</p>
<p>Note: there are a couple of different terms used to describe the sedimentation process. We can say that sedimentation tanks “capture” particles when particles are settled out. We can also say that sedimentation tanks “remove” particles. Both terms refer to the process of particles or floc settling out of suspension in water. If a particle is captured or removed by a sedimentation tank, it means that the particle is stuck in the tank and that water leaving the reactor will have fewer particles in it.</p>
<p>We will develop our definition of settle capture velocity using examples of a horizontal flow and vertical flow sedimentation tanks. It should be noted that there are many idealizations and simplifications made for modeling sedimentation tanks. We assume that water will move through the reactor as expected (in the case of the horizontal flow sedimentation tank, from one end to the other), but we know that there are many more fluids complications than are described here. We assume that everything is moving at the average velocity and there are no turbulence or velocity profiles. For the time being, we will ignore what will happen to particles once they are captured by the sedimentation tank. Our intuition tells us that particles which settle will need to be removed somehow, and that is correct. This will be discussed in later sections. For now, we only care about capturing the particles, and later we will care about what we do with them once they are captured.</p>

<li>In the “worst case scenario”, how far must a particle fall to reach the bottom of the tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>The “worst case scenario” is the condition in which a particle must travel the furthest in order to be successfully captured by the sedimentation tank. We assume that particles are evenly distributed throughout the height and width of the reactor entrance. Therefore, a particle entering at the top of the entrance of the reactor would need to fall a distance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> to reach the bottom. Any particle entering from a position lower than the top of the tank would need to fall a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt; H\)</span>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>How fast must the particle fall?</li>
</ol>
<p>We know that for a particle to fall to the bottom successfully, it needs to fall fast enough that it can reach the bottom before the water that is carrying it leaves the reactor. Water is carrying the particle across the reactor at the horizontal velocity speed, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_h\)</span>. Gravity is causing the particle to settle at its terminal velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_t\)</span>. In order to reach the bottom, that settling velocity needs to be the capture velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_c\)</span>, to ensure that the particle will reach the bottom of the reactor. We can see the path that the “worst case scenario” particle will take in the following figure.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[show horizontal flow sedimentation tank with capture velocity]]]]]]]]]</p>
<p>Capture velocity can be determined by the distance that a particle must travel and the time that the particle has to travel.</p>

<p>Thus, we have capture velocity which is a descriptor of a sedimentation tank. It determines how fast a particle has to settle in order to be reliably captured by a particular sedimentation tank, assuming idealized flow. The capture velocity is not a particle property, but rather a sedimentation tank property.</p>

<li>Will any particles that are smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> be captured in the sedimentation tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>This question is important because as stated in the beginning of this section, our discussion assumed that the particle in question was 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>. If we design a sedimentation tank to capture particles that are 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>, we also have to understand the impact of our design on particles smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>.</p>
<p>To answer this question, think about the two extremes of our reactor.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We could have a small particle entering the reactor at the top, in the same “worst case scenario”.

<li>We could have a small particle entering the reactor near the bottom, in a “best case scenario”. In this case, the particle does not have a large distance to fall because it is already close to the bottom of the tank.

<li>How far must a particle fall relative to the fluid to not be carried out the exit?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note how this question is different from the question we asked for the horizontal flow sedimentation tank. In the horizontal flow sedimentation tank, particles could settle to the bottom of the reactor. We care about particles settling to the bottom because we assume that if particles hit the bottom of the reactor, then they would be captured and would not leave the reactor. Remember, the goal of sedimentation is to remove particles from suspension in water. In the vertical flow sedimentation tank, we also want to remove particles from suspension, but because there is a different geometry, we now are interested in the relative movement of particle to water. If a particle is falling due to the forces of gravity, but also water is pushing up on it, the only way for a particle to remain in the reactor is if it either falls at the same velocity or faster than the water is pushing it.</p>
<p>If a particle is falling at the same velocity that water is moving it, it will be stationary in the reactor. Water flowing through the reactor moves a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>, which means that a stationary particle must settle the same distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in the same time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>.

<p>It doesn’t matter whether water is flowing horizontally or vertically in the tank. What determines the capture velocity is the flow rate and the plan view area of the sedimentation tank.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Will any particles that are smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> be captured in the sedimentation tank?</li>
</ol>
<p>This question is surprisingly complex because we have to consider what we have learned so far about sedimentation and also recall what we have learned about flocculation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the simple sedimentation approach. We can compare the vertical flow sedimentation tank with the horizontal flow sedimentation tank. In a horizontal flow tank, the capture of particles smaller than the design particle (35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span>) is possible depending on the height which the particle enters the reactor. In a vertical flow tank, all particles enter the reactor at the same height (which is the bottom of the tank). This means that any particle entering the reactor will need to fall the same distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> relative to the water if it will be captured. If particles smaller than 35 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu m\)</span> enter the reactor, they will not be captured because they are not able to settle fast enough.</p>
<p>However, we must also consider potential flocculation processes that could occur in the sedimentation tank. A sedimentation tank is still subject to the same laws of fluids as the flocculator, meaning that there will still be shear in the reactor. While it may not be as much shear as that introduced in the flocculator, there are still velocity gradients which mean that there could be some additional flocculation happening in the sedimentation tank. In the flocculator, the main mechanism that led to flocculation was the deformation of fluid which caused particles to collide. In the sedimentation tank, the main mechanism that can lead to flocculation is velocity gradients. Flocculation is provided by an opportunity for collision by differences in relative velocities of particles. Big particles in the sedimentation tank settle out but are still in suspension, and small particles continue to move up through the large particles. There is relative velocity between particles based on their terminal velocities.</p>
<p>Understanding relative velocities is very important to understand how vertical flow sedimentation tanks work. Let’s consider an example to develop our understanding of differential sedimentation. Imagine that two people are skydiving; one person is 150 lbs and the other person is 300 lbs. Assume that both people are using the same size parachutes and are jumping out of the same stationary helicopter. If the 150 lb person jumps out first and the 300 lb person jumps out a few moments after, what will happen? The 300 lb person will fall faster than the 150 lb person, causing a collision in the air. In a sedimentation tank, we would describe the collision due to differential sedimentation as flocculation because particles are colliding and growing.</p>
<p>Now that we understand differential settling and the potential for flocculation in a sedimentation tank, let’s revisit the original question. Can smaller particles be captured? The answer is that smaller particles can be capture only if they collide with other particles and grow so that they have a terminal velocity that is greater than the capture velocity. This flocculation that happens in the sedimentation tank is an additional mechanism for removing particles.</p>
<p>There are some important differences between horizontal and vertical sedimentation tanks. Many of these points will be discussed later when we learn specifically about the AguaClara design process, but it is important to get introduced to these ideas now. We know that vertical flow tanks require careful attention to the delivery of water in the bottom of the tank and the extraction of water in the top of the tank. We know that vertical and horizontal flow tanks may have different velocities and turbulence capacities due to plan view areas.

<h1>Components of an AguaClara Sedimentation Tank<a class="headerlink" href="#components-of-an-aguaclara-sedimentation-tank" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Note: this section should use words and figures to describe the different parts of the tank and what their purpose is, with brief explanation of how they work.</p>
<p>In this section, we will develop a conceptual understanding of the sedimentation tank using figures and images. We will be using a mixture of terminology typically found in water treatment settings and AguaClara-specific terminology. We will discuss the different parts of the sedimentation tank in the sequence that a parcel of water would encounter it, from the beginning of the unit process to the end. The three main sections are 1) how water enters the sedimentation tank, 2) how water moves through the sedimentation tank, and 3) how water leaves the sedimentation tank.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[INCLUDE PICTURE/VIDEO OF SED TANKS WITH FLOW SHOWN BY ARROWS]]]]]]]]]]]]]]</p>
<p><strong>Inlet Channel</strong></p>
<p>After water exits the flocculator, it is ready for sedimentation. In AguaClara plants, there is one flocculator per treatment train. However, depending on the plant flow rate, one plant may have multiple sedimentation units operating in parallel; we call each of these sedimentation units a ‘bay’ or a ‘tank’. Because there may be multiple sedimentation bays, we have to distribute flocculated water evenly between the bays. To do this, we have an <strong>inlet channel</strong>, which receives water from the flocculator and passes it to the sedimentation bays. The channel is long, concrete, and relatively shallow. The objective of the channel is to distribute water and flocs to the sedimentation bays without allowing any settling in the floc channel. In the bottom of this channel, there are pipes that lead to the bottom of each sedimentation bay.</p>
<p>Does the water in the inlet channel get evenly distributed between the different bays? If not, which bay will receive the most water? We know from our understanding of fluids and flow distribution that in a pipe (or channel) with multiple orifices that is closed at one end, the distribution of flow is nonuniform along the length of the pipe. This nonuniformity is due to differences in velocity and pressure in different parts of the pipe. At the end of the pipe, there is low velocity and thus high pressure, driving the flow through the orifices at the end. We will revisit this concept later to understand how AguaClara plants attempt to minimize this unequal flow distribution.</p>
<p>Sedimentation units have multiple bays for a few different reasons. Plants with higher flow rates require more sedimentation tanks because the flow through each bay is limited by other design constraints that will be discussed later, namely upflow velocity. Additionally, it is good to have more than one bay for maintenance purposes; if one bay needs to be cleaned, we want to always have another than can be working. Stubs of drain pipes can be used to shut down one bay of a sedimentation system for cleaning.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>Bottom Geometry: Inlet Manifold, Diffusers, and Jet Reverser **</p>
<p>Now, we will focus on a single bay of the sedimentation tank. Flocculated water enters a pipe in the bottom of the inlet channel and travels down a few feet. The pipe then has a 90 degree bend and extends along the bottom of the entire length of the sedimentation bay. This section of pipe that distributes water at the bottom of the sedimentation bay is referred to as the <strong>inlet manifold</strong>.</p>
<p>Water exits the inlet manifold through a series of orifices and <strong>diffusers</strong> in the bottom of the pipe. Orifices refer to the holes that are drilled into the underside of the manifold while diffusers are what we call short stubs of pipe that extend from the orifice, perpendicular to the inlet manifold. The orifices and diffusers point down, to the bottom of the sedimentation bay and extend along the length of the pipe at regular intervals to ensure that water is evenly distributed within the bay. The ends of the diffuser tubes are flattened so that they are thin rectangles and when placed side-by-side achieve a line jet effect.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[NEED TO TALK ABOUT FLOW DISTRIBUTION / MANIFOLDS PPT]]]]]]]]]]]
Recall the discussion about flow distribution in the inlet channel. We know that the sedimentation bay furthest away from the flocculator would receive the most flow from the inlet channel due to fluids principles. Along this same line, the orifice at the end of the manifold would receive the most flow. However, the diffuser system greatly impacts the overall flow distribution in an attempt to make the flow more equal in all parts of the system. To understand how the diffusers work, we will explain a concept referred to as “sedimentation tank as a circuit”.</p>
<p>The inlet manifold diffuser system straightens the fluid jets that are exiting the manifold so that they have no horizontal velocity component. This is critical because even a small horizontal velocity causes a large scale circulation that transports flocs directly to the top of the sedimentation tank. Inlet manifolds without flow straightening diffusers are commonly used in vertical flow sedimentation tanks including designs by leading competitors.</p>
<p>The diffusers create a line jet that spans the entire length of the sedimentation tank. The water from the inlet manifold and diffusers enter the bay going down, but we want the water to ultimately flow up to make our vertical flow sedimentation tank. To get the flow upwards, we use a <strong>jet reverser</strong>, which is half of a pipe that is laid in the bottom of the bay.</p>
<p>You may be wondering, why do we need a jet reverser in the first place? Why don’t we just have the diffusers point up to avoid having to change the flow in the first place? The answer has multiple components. First, if the diffusers were to point up, they could clog if anything settles in them. Second, if flow were just to point directly up, it would not have an opportunity to sufficiently spread out the flow in the sedimentation bay, which could lead to “short-circuiting” and poor flow distribution overall. Third, the jet reverser functions as a way to keep flocs suspended by ensuring that anything that settles will be propelled back up from the force of the diffuser jet. The jet reverser and diffuser alignment is not symmetrical; the diffusers are offset from the jet reverser centerline. This is intentionally done to ensure that the diffuser jet never collapses to promote a floc blanket, which will be discussed next. There is a lot of research interest in determining the optimal upflow velocity for floc blankets considering that high velocity is better for resuspension but breaks more flocs. Currently, AguaClara plants use an upflow velocity of 1 mm/s.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[[PICTURE OF FLAT BOTTOM, CENTERED, and OFFSET JET]]]]]]]]]]]]</p>
<p>As shown above, in a flat bottom geometry, flocs settle in the corners of the tank because there is no direct flow of water to resuspend it. Flocs fall in such a way that the corners of the tank will fill first, with more and more flocs settling on them until the angle of repose is created. This angle that is occupied by flocs suggests that if we want to avoid having flocs settle, we should fill the bottom of the tank in with concrete and create a sloped bottom so that there are no surfaces for settling.</p>
<p>The inlet manifold, diffusers, and jet reverser work with a <strong>sloped bottom geometry</strong>. The bottom geometry allows for smooth flow expansion to the entire plan view area of the bay, and ensures that all flocs that settle are transported to the jet reverser. The diffusers do not touch the bottom of the tank so that flocs on both sides of the diffuser can fall into the jet reverser for resuspension. Thus there is no accumulation of settled flocs in the main sedimentation basin. Sludge that is allowed to accumulate in the bottom of sedimentation tanks in tropical and temperate climates decomposes anaerobically and generates methane. The methane forms gas bubbles that carry suspended solids to the top of the sedimentation tank and cause a reduction in particle removal efficiency. The AguaClara sedimentation tank bottom geometry prevents sludge accumulation while also ensuring good flow distribution.</p>
<p>So we know that the diffusers, jet reverser, and sloped bottom ensure that no sludge accumulates on the bottom by creating a system to resuspend any settled flocs. What are the failure modes for this system? For one, we need to ensure that the jet of water exiting the diffuser is able to maintain its upward direction after the jet reverser. The jet is influenced by the flows that are coming down the sloped sides of the tank. Thus, the jet must have enough momentum to remain upwards even with the momentum from other flows downwards. We can control the momentum of the jet by controlling the cross-sectional area of the diffuser slot. A smaller cross-sectional area will increase the velocity of the jet but the mass is the same because the flow rate for the plant is the same, thus increasing the momentum.</p>

</dl>
<p><strong>Floc Blanket and Floc Hopper</strong></p>
<p>The line jet from the diffusers enters the jet reverser to force flow up through the sedimentation bay. The vertical upward jet momentum is used to resuspend flocs that have settled to the bottom of the sedimentation tank. The resuspended flocs form a fluidized bed which is called a <strong>floc blanket</strong>. The bed is fluidized because flocs are kept in suspension by the upflowing water.</p>
<p>For a floc blanket to form, a sedimentation system requires that all flocs be returned to the bottom of the sedimentation tank and requires that all settled flocs be resuspended by incoming water. As will be discussed soon, plate settlers are used to return flocs to the bottom of the bay, while the jet reverser and sloped bottom geometry allow for floc resuspension. Any surface with a horizontal component in a sedimentation tank must be sloped to allow settled flocs to return to the resuspension zone. A flat bottom geometry does not allow for the fomration of a floc blanket.</p>
<p>Floc blankets improve the performance of a sedimentation tank and reduces settled water turbidity by a factor of 10 (Garland et al., 2017) for multiple reasons.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Additional collision potential. The high concentration of particles, with a suspended solids concentrations of approximately 1-5 g/L, leads to an increase in collisions and particle aggregation. As discussed for vertical flow sedimentation tanks, flocculation can occur in a floc blanket due to shear from suspended flocs which are colliding and growing. Fluidized flocs provide a collision potential of a few thousand. This collision potential is small compared to the collision potential from the flocculator. So how does a small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> cause a large reduction in turbidity? The answer may be that the lower <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> value provides an opportunity for all flocs to grow larger without floc breakup. The high concentration of flocs provides many opportunities for clay particles to collide with big flocs, but it is not clear if or when those collisions are successful. Which flocs are active and which flocs are inactive in the floc blanket?</li>
</ul>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[rhetorical or no?]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[[[FILTER VS FLOCCULATOR QUESTION]]]]]]]]]]]]
We just explained that flocs in the floc blanket cause shear and energy gradients, thus leading to collisions and growing flocs. This explanation suggests that the floc blanket acts like a flocculator. However, there is another model for floc blanker operation in which the floc blanket acts like a filter. Although you haven’t necessarily learned about filters yet, all you need to know for now is that sand in a sand filter creates head loss. The sand is essentially inert and creates shear but isn’t “colliding” with particles going past it. So which is it? Are floc blankets like flocculators or filters, and how can we find out? We can delve a little more into the discussion about relative <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> values between the flocculator and the floc blanket. Through laboratory testing, we know that flocculators have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> values on the order of 20,000 and the floc blanket have on the order of 4,000.  If the filter model of floc blankets was correct and the flocs were just taking up space and causing head loss, we would expect a 24,000 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> flocculator to function the same as a 20,000 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> flocculator coupled with a 4,000 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> floc blanket. However, if we just changed our flocculator to be closer to 24,000 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span>, we would have not gotten the impressive removal efficiency that the floc blankets demonstrate. So, we must assume that large flocs in the floc blanket must be involved in some collisions with the smaller flocs going through it. However, we still do not have a model set of equations to describe floc blanket performance.</p>

The <strong>floc hopper</strong> is a “weir” that provides an opportunity for floc consolidation. Without the floc blanket transport system, other methods would be required to remove accumulated sludge in the bay. Mechanical sludge removal systems are common alternatives but are well known to be costly to install and a challenge to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The floc hopper controls the depth of the floc blanket because as the floc blanket grows, it will eventually reach the top of the floc hopper. Because flocs are more dense than water, the flocs “spill” over the edge of the floc hopper which allows the floc blanket to stay a constant height while sludge accumulates and consolodates in the floc hopper. The ideal depth of the floc blanket has not yet been determined. Floc blanket flow into the floc hopper is a function of the mass flux of particles into the sedimentation tank. We need to characterize the consolidation rate of the flocs to optimize the floc hopper design.</p>
<p>The floc hopper allows for a self-cleaning sedimentation tank. By gravity, flocs are sent over to a floc hopper. This means that operators only have to clean the sedimentation tank once every three to six months because there is no stagnant accumulation of anoxic sludge. When operators do clean the sedimentation tank, they are primarily cleaning plate settlers. Under normal operation, operators can open the floc hopper drain valve whenever they want to easily drain the sludge.</p>
<p>A benefit of the floc blanket is that flocs can be removed without mechanical assistance, but why do we need the floc hopper at all? Why can’t we just install drain holes in the bottom of the sedimentation tank that any accumulated sludge is removed? This is a question that plagued AguaClara in its early years. At first, before we were able to successfully build and operate a floc blanket, we had sludge accumulate in the bottom of the sedimentation bay. Therefore, we needed to remove the sludge with drain holes at the bottom. However, to have those drain holes where the sludge was accumulating in the tank, designers made a flat bottom tank. But as we now know, the flat bottom tank is part of the reason that there wasn’t any floc blanket forming. As soon as we realized that we could grow a floc blanket with a sloped bottom tank and a jet reverser, we could not use drain holes in the bottom of the tank. Why? Because in the bottom of tanks with floc blankets, there is no settling. Drain holes at the bottom of a sloped tank would be draining a combination of flocculated water and floc blanket water, neither of which are consolidated thus making the draining ineffective and inefficient. A benefit of the floc hopper is that  there is no upflow velocity, which means that the sludge is able to settle and become more dense, allowing for less water waste from draining sludge.</p>
