"Historically flocculation was assumed to involve collisions between all "
"particles in the suspension. The Smoluchowski coagulation equation was "
"published in 1916 and uses a population balance approach to track the "
"number of particles of each size based on the probability of collisions "
"between all possible combinations of particle sizes. The Smoluchowski "
"equation is a statement of the conservation of mass and as such it "
"certainly applies to flocculation in drinking water treatment plants. The"
" challenge is that the probability of collisions between all possible "
"combinations of particle sizes must be somehow known in order to use the "
"model. The complexity of obtaining the collision probabilities and the "
"complexity of solving the equation have preventing use of the "
"Smoluchowski equation for design or operation of flocculators."

"For most of the past century there have been two explanations for the "
"particle interactions during flocculation based on the addition of a "
"coagulant. The first explanation was that the positive charge of the "
"coagulant neutralizes the negative charge of naturally occurring "
"particles and thus eliminates the electrostatic repulsion that was "
"preventing aggregation. The second explanation was called sweep "
"flocculation and was the catch all explanation that was used to describe "
"observations that didn't fit the charge neutralization explanation. "
"Particles were presumed to be swept into a mesh of coagulant precipitate "
