"Estimation of velocity gradients for various flow geometries is the basis"
" for the design of rapid mix, flocculators, and plate settlers. Thus, our"
" goal is to define the velocity gradients consistently across a range of "
"possible flow regimes. There are three approaches to calculating the "
"average velocity gradient within a control volume. 1) Use the Navier "
"Stokes equations and solve for the spatially averaged velocity gradient. "
"1) Use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to solve for the spatially "
"averaged velocity gradient. 1) Use the total mechanical energy loss in "
"the control volume to calculate the energy dissipation rate. Estimate the"
" velocity gradient directly from the energy dissipation rate, "
":math:`G_{CS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar\\varepsilon}{\\nu}}`, as defined by "
"Camp and Stein in 1943 (Camp, T. R., and Stein, P. C. (1943) ‘‘Velocity "
"Gradients and Hydraulic Work in Fluid Motion,’’ J. Boston Soc. Civil "
"Eng., 30, 203–221.)."

"The first approach would be ideal but is difficult in practice because "
"Navier Stokes solutions are only available for limited geometries and "
"laminar flow. CFD could be used but is difficult to use as a general "
"engineering design approach given the large number of geometries that are"
" used in drinking water treatment plants. For these reasons we will use "
"the control volume approach to estimate the average velocity gradient. "
"This method incorrectly assumes that the energy dissipation rate is "
"completely uniform in the control volume and hence the velocity gradient "
"is also uniform. This method results in an over estimation of the "
"velocity gradient. The Camp-Stein estimate of :math:`G_{CS}` is based on "
"a control volume where the velocity gradient is uniform. Consider a layer"
" of fluid of depth :math:`H` and apply a velocity, :math:`v` at the top "
"of the fluid. The velocity gradient, :math:`G`, is thus "
":math:`\\frac{v}{H}` everywhere in the fluid. The force required to move "
"the top of the fluid at velocity v can be obtained from the required "
