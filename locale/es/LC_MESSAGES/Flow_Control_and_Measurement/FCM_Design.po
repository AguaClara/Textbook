"Before diving into the technologies, recall the purpose of the chemicals "

"‘concentration of chemical’ *in the water we are trying to treat*, not in"
" the stock tanks of the chemicals. `Coagulant "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation_(water_treatment)>`_ like "
"alum, PAC, and some iron-based chemicals are used to turn small particles"
" into bigger particles, allowing them to be captured more easily. Waters "
"with high `turbidity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity>`_, "
"indicative of a lot of particles like clay and bacteria, require more "
"coagulant to treat effectively. Additionally, waters with a lot of "
"`organic matter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_matter>`_ require "
"significantly more coagulant to treat. `Chlorine "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_chlorination>`_ is used to disinfect"
" water that has already been fully treated. A proper and consistent "
"chlorine dose is required, as too low of a dose creates a risk of "
"reintroduction of pathogens in the distribution system and too high of a "

"As has been mentioned previously, the amount of chlorine and coagulant "
"that must be added to the raw water changes depending on the flow rate of"
" the plant; the change is necessary to keep the dose constant. More water"
" flowing through the plant means more chlorine is necessary to maintain "
"the dose of chlorine in the treated water. For coagulant, there are also "
"other factors aside from plant flow rate that impact the required dose, "
"including the turbidity and amount of organic matter in the water. The "
"operator must be able to change the dose of both coagulant and chlorine "
"quickly and easily, and they must be able to know the value of the new "
"dose they set. The “Almost Linear” Flow Controller accomplishes this by "
"having a large number of holes in the flow control pipe next to the CHT. "
"This large number of holes gives the operator many options for adjusting "
"the dose, and let them quickly change the flow of chemicals into the raw "
