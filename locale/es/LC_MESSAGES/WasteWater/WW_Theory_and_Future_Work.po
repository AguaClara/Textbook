"One of the core ideas of the AguaClara design process is that reactor "
"geometry and hydraulic design are critical to obtain the target "
"performance. Environmental engineers have tended to focus on the "
"microbiology and chemistry of unit processes and have sometimes neglected"
" the interactions between fluids, particles, and reactor geometry. We "
"hypothesize that it will be possible to significantly improve on the "
"conventional UASB design by inventing a anaerobic digester that accounts "
"for the interactions between fluids, particles, and reactor geometry. "
"Similarly, we hypothesize that it will be possible to dramatically "
"improve the design of ultra low energy atmospheric oxygen transfer into "
"aerobic reactors."

"Upflow anaerobic settled bed (UASB) are conventionally known as upflow "
"anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. The word \"blanket\" is frequently "
"used in the field of water and wastewater treatment to refer to a "
"fluidized bed of suspended particles (see floc blanket). Unfortunately "
"that definition is not clearly communicated by the term \"blanket\" and "
"this has led to confusion of the fundamental mechanisms at play in UASB "
"reactors."

"Fluidized bed reactors required inlet and bottom geometry configurations "
"that prevent settled particles from accumulating anywhere on the bottom "
"of the reactor. Many UASB reactors have flat bottoms and the inlets are "
"not designed to ensure continuous resuspension of settled particles. Thus"
" the use of the term  \"blanket\" for conventional UASB reactors is a "
"misnomer."

"UASB reactors typically require hydraulic residence times of x to y hours"
" and have a height of z meters. The result is a maximum upflow velocity "
"of z/y mm/s. This upflow velocity is orders of magnitude lower than the "
"terminal velocity of the particles and thus it is clear that UASB "
"reactors are primarily settled beds of sludge."

"The flow distribution through settled sludge is very unlikely to be "
"uniform. The flow is likely to erode a mostly vertical path the shortest "
"distance between the inlet and the top of the settled sludge. There "
"doesn't appear to be any mechanism that would lead to the idealized "
"uniform flow distribution. Thus conventional UASB reactors are evidently "
"plagued by short circuiting with actual hydraulic residence times a "
"fraction of the design value. (Cite literature in support of this "
"hypothesis.) This leads to short-circuiting and formation of preference "
"flow patterns in sludge bed which in turn leads to dead zones in the "
"sludge as well as improper treatment (`Pena, 2006 "

"The upflow velocity required to maintain a fully fluidized bed of the "
"anaerobic granules is approximately (cite AguaClara UASB research by Cho,"
" et al. who measured the sedimentation velocity of anaerobic granules) x "
"mm/s. At this velocity the height of the reactor would need to be x m in "
"order to achieve the target hydraulic residence time of y hrs. This is "
"not a practical design for community scale reactors and thus it would be "
"advantageous to invent an alternate system for providing more uniform "
"flow through the solids that contain the microorganisms in a UASB "
"reactor."

"Our proposed solution to this mismatch between required upflow velocity "
"for a fluidized bed and target hydraulic residence time is to use a "
"pulsed flow inlet. The pulsed flow will be designed to lift the entire "
"settled bed off of the floor of the UASB reactor so that the influent "
"wastewater is uniformly distributed to the bottom of the reactor. We "
"hypothesize that the settled bed will then break apart and settled into "
"the band of fresh wastewater that is on the bottom of the reactor. With "
"this proposed mechanism it is clear that a critical parameter is the "
"depth of wastewater that should be injected with each pulse. It is likely"
" that this depth of fresh wastewater should be"

"The measured hydraulic residence time for trickling filters is very "
"short. This suggests that with proper design the ASD could be very "
"compact. `Hinton and Stense (1991) <https://www-sciencedirect-"
"com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/science/article/pii/0043135491901179>`_ "
"measured the residence time per unit length to be 30 seconds/meter. Thus "
"for a 4 meter deep trickling filter the residence time would be 120 "
"seconds. If this is accurate, then we may be able to achieve a compact "
"design if we can pack stainless steel cables close together (order 4 mm "
"spacing) AND achieve uniform flow distribution. In addition, `Hinton and "
"Stense (1991) <https://www-sciencedirect-"

"confirms that a compact, well-designed ASD may be smaller than AguaClara "
"sedimentation tanks that traditionally have operated at 1 mm/s."
