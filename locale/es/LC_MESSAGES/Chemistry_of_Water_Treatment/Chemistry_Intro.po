"Thus both aluminum and iron coagulants are more polar than water. It is "
"possible that their strong polarity enables them to displace the water "
"that is bound to particles' surfaces and then form bonds with those "
"surfaces. In order to displace water molecules that are bound to the "
"particles surfaces, the coagulants must have stronger bonds to particles "
"surfaces than the polar water molecules and thus it seems likely that "
"coagulants must be more polar than water."

"The coagulants used for drinking water treatment are acidic and thus "

"This is also the `pH range set by the EPA secondary standards for "

"water sources are within this pH range, there are some waters with more "
"extreme values of pH. The aluminum and iron based coagulants are also "
"acidic and in some waters the pH may drop below the ideal range when "
"adding the coagulant. When the pH is outside the acceptable range it is "

"Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) is another aluminum based coagulant that "
"performs similarly to alum. PACl is manufactured by slowly titrating an "
"acidic solution containing dissolved aluminum with a base (in the "
"chemical plant) to produce a meta-stable and soluble polymeric aluminum. "
"PACl consumes less alkalinity (ANC) because it is partially neutralized "
"by the titration with a base. In addition, the aluminum mass fraction of "
"PACl is higher than in alum because there are no attached water "
"molecules. The mass of PACl required for flocculation is less the mass of"
" alum required. This is due largely to the higher aluminum fraction. The "
