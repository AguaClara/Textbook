"Create a function to return maximum energy dissipation rate along the "
"centerline of a free jet given inputs of distance downstream of the jet "
"(along the centerline), jet velocity, and initial jet diameter. You will "
"find the Rapid Mix powerpoint useful in finding a relationship between "
"these variables."

"Use your function to create a graph of the centerline (maximum) energy "
"dissipation rate as a function of distance from jet origin. \\* Use an "
"initial diameter of DiamJet = 10 cm and a velocity of VelJet = 1 m/s. \\*"
" Use a range of 7 to 20 jet diameters when creating the graph. \\* Use "
"units of meters for the x-axis and W/kg for the y-axis. Make sure to "
"label your axes correctly."
