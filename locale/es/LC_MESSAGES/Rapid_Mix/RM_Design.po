"As of 2018 the design for AguaClara rapid mix units has been based on the"
" goal of achieving a target energy dissipation rate. This in turn was "
"based on the assumption that it was important to rapidly mix the "
"coagulant with the water, perhaps to minimize the self-aggregation of "
"coagulant nanoparticles. We don't yet have any experimental evidence that"
" rapid mixing is important and it is quite likely that the energy "
"dissipation rate found in the hydraulic flocculator is sufficient to "
"provide the required mixing."

"The design requirements for fluid mixing of the coagulant is an area that"
" needs research. If the goal is to reduce the amount of self-aggregation "
"of coagulant nanoparticles, then it is possible that an investment in "
"energy to mix faster could be offset by a reduction in the chemical "
"demand. This tradeoff needs a full economic and resource-use analysis. "
"Regardless of the outcome of that analysis, it is essential that we "
"evaluate options to reduce the energy input required to reduce the mixing"
" time. One excellent option for reducing the energy required is to reduce"
" the length scale of the largest eddies that are required for mixing."

"The mixing time is dominated by the turnover time of the largest eddies. "
"Given an energy dissipation rate (or a velocity gradient) the mixing time"
" is reduced if the required length scale of the mixing is reduced."

"We will design a rapid mix unit that has an array of injection ports and "
"couple that with flow expansions that will generate eddies at that same "
"length scale. The reason for creating flow contractions at the same "
"length scale as the distance between injection ports is to immediately "
"create eddies of the right size rather than creating much larger eddies "
"and then waiting for the turbulence cascade of eddies sizes to create the"
" smaller eddies. By creating eddies with dimensions similar to the "
"injection port separation we will dissipate the energy as quickly as "
"possible (at that smaller length scale) and thus decrease the mixing "
"time."

"We can use the center to center distance of the contractions (and "
"injection ports) as the eddy length scale. This is because the eddies "
"will need to mix over the length scale of the spacing of the injection "
"ports."

"The relationship between head loss and energy dissipation rate is based "

"The rapid mix unit will be created by placing round cylinders vertically "
