"Our understanding of the coagulant nanoparticle attachment to suspended "
"particles and dissolved species is currently quite speculative. This is "
"an area that requires substantial research and modeling because has the "
"potential to significantly influence the design of flocculators. We have "
"anecdotal evidence that the process of transporting coagulant "
"nanoparticles to suspended particle surfaces may be a slow, rate-limiting"
