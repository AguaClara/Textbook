"Dissolved gas supersaturation and subsequent bubble formation can cause "
"significant performance deterioration in drinking water treatment plants."
" Supersaturation means that the dissolved gas concentration is greater "
"than the equilibrium concentration. The liquid phase equilibrium "
"concentration of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute partial "
"pressure of the gas in the gas phase. This relationship is described by "
"Henry's law."

"Bubbles carry flocs rapidly to the top of the sedimentation tank where "
"they form a surface mat of flocs. The surface mat of flocs isn't "
"necessarily harmful to plant performance, but it is a nuisance and "
"requires that the operators scrape the flocs to remove them from the "
"sedimentation tank. Some of the rising flocs are swept into the exit "
"manifold and thus the settled water turbidity can be significantly "
"increased by these rising flocs."

"Filtration performance can be severely harmed by gas bubbles. The bubbles"
" form in the pores of the filter and are unable to leave the pore due to "
"surface tension. Filter media can fill rapidly with gas bubbles and this "
"results in increased head loss or decreased flow through the filter. "
"Bubble formation can significantly reduce the filter run time. The amount"
" of bubble formation is strongly dependent on the pressure in the filter."
" Filters that operate with a deep column of water on top of the filter "
"bed can be unaffected by dissolved gasses if the high pressure within the"
" filter raises the equilibrium dissolved gas concentration above the "
"actual dissolved gas concentration. Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filters "
"are more vulnerable to bubble formation that Open Stacked Rapid Sand "
"Filters because of the difference in pressure in the sand bed. This "
"pressure analysis also reveals that gas bubble formation will tend to "
"occur at the lowest pressure zone in the filter bed. This low pressure "
"zone can occur in a down flow filter right below the partially clogged "
"section of the bed because of the decrease in pressure due to head loss."
