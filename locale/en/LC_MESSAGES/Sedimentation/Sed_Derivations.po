"To understand how water flows in the sedimentation tank, we must "
"understand how the water velocity changes with the geometry. There are "
"four distinct zones in the sedimentation tank: 1) the velocity of water "
"exiting the diffusers, 2) the velocity of water moving through the floc "
"blanket, 3) the velocity of water that enters the plate settlers, and 4) "
"the velocity of water through the plate settlers. The geometry of the "
"sedimentation tank changes in these four zones, so we will follow these "
"changes to make sure that we understand the conservation of flow. The "
"flow going through the sedimentation tank is the same everywhere, but "

"For another example of flow conservation, let's consider the relationship"

"v_{z_{Active}}*B`. :math:`B` is the center-to-center distance between "
"plate settlers, and does not take into account the thickness of plate "
"settlers. Considering only the center-to-center distance means that the "
"area for water to travel through does to change from before the plate "
"settlers to within the plate settlers because we are not accounting for "
"any thickness. If the area does not change, then velocity should also not"
" change to keep flow conserved. However, if we are to account for "
"thickness, we must discuss :math:`S` which is the spacing between plate "
"settlers. This does take into account the change in area,  which means "

"velocity constraint comes from the need to keep flocs resuspended. We "
"also know that in the active region of our sedimentation tank, we want an"
" upflow velocity of 1 mm/s. Additionally, because diffusers are a key "
"component of our \"sedimentation tank as a circuit\", we want to "
"precisely control head loss in the jet leaving the jet reverser because "
"that will help us achieve uniform flow within and between sedimentation "
"tanks. AguaClara designs set head loss in the jet constant at 1 cm."
