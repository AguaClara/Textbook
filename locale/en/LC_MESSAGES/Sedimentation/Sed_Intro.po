"Sedimentation is a gravity-driven unit process in which suspended flocs "
"are settled out from water. Large flocs made up of many primary particles"
" and coagulant will settle if given enough time. Sedimentation is "
"commonly preceded by coagulation/flocculation processes - "
"coagulation/flocculation aim to form flocs which will be large enough to "
"settle in sedimentation - and is commonly followed by filtration "
"processes for further treatment. Sludge consolidation processes are often"
" present alongside sedimentation to reduce the waste stream of settled "
"flocs. Optimizing sedimentation is important because the more particles "
"that sedimentation can remove, the fewer particles the filter will have "
"to remove. This is good because filters can only handle a small amount of"
" solids, and cleaning the filters with backwash uses a lot of water so we"
" want to reduce the number of backwashes. The goal of sedimentation is to"
" concentrate a waste stream of flocs, or sludge."

"To introduce you to sedimentation, we will begin with a simple example. "
"If a jar of water filled with flocs was left at rest, flocs would begin "
"to settle due to gravitational forces pulling them down. Large flocs "
"would settle first, but if left for long enough, all flocs would settle "
"to the bottom of the jar. In its most basic form, the jar represents a "
"sedimentation tank in which flocculated water is treated. Settled flocs "
"are waste and the water on the top of the jar, referred to as the "
"supernatant, is the settled water."

"Constraints of space, time, and cost make it important to optimize the "
"settling process. It would not be realistic to design water treatment "
"systems that use the basic jar-like system to settle flocs because large "
"flow rates would require unreasonably large reactor volumes and long "
"retention times. The goal of sedimentation reactor design is to employ "
"geometries that promote settling and allow for fast treatment with small "
"footprints."

"What if we were to do the same jar experiment with raw water that did not"
" go through successful coagulation and flocculation? Would we observe the"
" same settling and successful particle removal? To answer this, we must "
"recall information learned in the section on coagulation and "
"flocculation; those two treatment processes serve to destabilize and "
"agglomerate particles to form flocs that will be heavy enough to settle. "
"If the particles are colloids and are not destabilized, no amount of time"
" will allow for the settling. This emphasizes the fact that successful "
"sedimentation can only happen with successful coagulation and "
"flocculation steps before it."

"Note how this question is different from the question we asked for the "
"horizontal flow sedimentation tank. In the horizontal flow sedimentation "
"tank, particles could settle to the bottom of the reactor. We care about "
"particles settling to the bottom because we assume that if particles hit "
"the bottom of the reactor, then they would be captured and would not "
"leave the reactor. Remember, the goal of sedimentation is to remove "
"particles from suspension in water. In the vertical flow sedimentation "
"tank, we also want to remove particles from suspension, but because there"
" is a different geometry, we are now interested in the relative movement "
"of particle to water. If a particle is falling due to the forces of "
"gravity, but also water is pushing up on it, the only way for a particle "

"Let's start with the simple sedimentation approach. We can compare the "
"vertical flow sedimentation tank with the horizontal flow sedimentation "
"tank. In a horizontal flow tank, the capture of particles smaller than "
"the design particle (35 :math:`\\mu m`) is possible depending on the "
"height which the particle enters the reactor. In a vertical flow tank, "
"all particles enter the reactor at the same height (which is the bottom "
"of the tank). This means that any particle entering the reactor will need"
" to fall the same distance :math:`H` in time :math:`\\theta` relative to "
"the water if it will be captured. If particles smaller than 35 "
":math:`\\mu m` enter the reactor, they will not be captured because they "
"are not able to settle fast enough."

"However, we must also consider potential flocculation processes that "
"could occur in the sedimentation tank. A sedimentation tank is still "
"subject to the same laws of fluids as the flocculator, meaning that there"
" will still be shear in the reactor. While it may not be as much shear as"
" that introduced in the flocculator, there are still velocity gradients "
"which mean that there could be some additional flocculation happening in "
"the sedimentation tank. In the flocculator, the main mechanism that led "
"to flocculation was the deformation of fluid which caused particles to "
"collide. In the sedimentation tank, the main mechanism that can lead to "
"flocculation is velocity gradients. Flocculation is provided by an "
"opportunity for collision by differences in relative velocities of "
"particles. Big particles in the sedimentation tank settle out but are "
"still in suspension, and small particles continue to move up through the "
"large particles. There is relative velocity between particles based on "
"their terminal velocities."

"Understanding relative velocities is very important to understand how "
"vertical flow sedimentation tanks work. Let's consider an example to "

" people are skydiving; one person is 150 lbs and the other person is 300 "
"lbs. Assume that both people are using the same size parachutes and are "
"jumping out of the same stationary helicopter. If the 150 lb person jumps"
" out first and the 300 lb person jumps out a few moments after, what will"
" happen? The 300 lb person will fall faster than the 150 lb person, "
"causing a collision in the air. In a sedimentation tank, we would "
"describe the collision due to differential sedimentation as flocculation "
"because particles are colliding and growing."

"Now that we understand differential settling and the potential for "

"particles can be captured only if they collide with other particles and "
"grow so that they have a terminal velocity that is greater than the "
"capture velocity. This flocculation that happens in the sedimentation "
"tank is an additional mechanism for removing particles."
