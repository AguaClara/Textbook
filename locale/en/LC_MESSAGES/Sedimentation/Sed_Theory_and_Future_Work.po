"We hypothesize that the flocs in floc filters serve as collectors that "
"primary particles attach to. We suspect that collisions between primary "
"particles and large flocs are possible in the sedimentation tank because "
"the rotational velocity of the flocs is small relative to the "
"sedimentation velocity of the flocs. If the rotational velocity of the "
"flocs is small, then a stagnation point will exist on the floc and a "
"finite flow of fluid will come within a primary particle radius of the "
"floc. Thus we expect primary particle removal in floc filters to be "
"proportional to the number of collectors that a primary particle passes "
"while in the floc filter."

"The number of collectors that a primary particle passes is proportional "

"As we have explored increasing the upflow velocity in sedimentation tanks"

"Would it be possible to increase the concentration of the floc filter "
"and thus increase the collision rate? At 3 mm/s upflow velocity there are"

"We propose to test this by installing a settled floc recycle line. The "
"recycle line will connect to the bottom surface of the tube settler below"
" the location of the floc weir. From there is will carry concentrated "
"sludge to the very bottom of the sedimentation tank where it will pass "

"There must be an optimal amount of recycled flocs for a floc filter. Of "
"course, one possiblity is that the optimal recycle is zero. Recycled "
"flocs increase the floc filter concentration and thus increase the rate "
"of collisions between primary particles and flocs. The recycled flocs "
"also decrease the residence time in the floc filter and thus decrease "
"the total number of collisions between primary particles and flocs. It "

"Our goal is to find the optimal recycle ratio. Optimal is defined as the "
