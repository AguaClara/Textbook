"The hydraulic controls provide the basis for efficient and robust water "
"treatment plant operation. Water must move through unit processes and "
"between unit processes and the flow passages must be designed to meet "
"various constraints. One constraint is that water that is carrying a "
"significant amount of sediment (flocculator and sedimentation tank inlet)"
" must have sufficient velocity and turbulence levels to minimize "
"sedimentation.  A more challenging constraint is that the flow must be "
"divided equally between parallel processes. Flow distribution through "
"parallel paths is a key hydraulic design constraint for all municipal "
"scale water treatment plants. The parallel path constraint only goes away"
" for laboratory scale processes where there is a single tube settler and "
"a filter with a single layer of sand. A schematic illustrating the "
"electrical circuit analogy is shown in :numref:`figure_circuit`."
