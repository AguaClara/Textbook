msgid ""
"The 60 cm diameter EStaRS filters at El PODA had a very high head loss of"
" 43 cm within a few minutes of ending backwash. The maximum available "
"head is only 50 cm and thus filter runs lasted only a few hours. El PODA "
"was the 2nd site where 60 cm diameter EStaRS filters were used. Given "
"that the filter backwashed just fine without excess head required it "
"appeared that the inlet system was performing as expected and did not "
"have excessive head loss."

"The key insight was that the top two layers of sand stopped producing "
"filter water soon after beginning a filter run. A complete stoppage means"
" that clogging ISN'T the issue! Clogging would decrease the flow rate, "
"but it wouldn't stop flow because the clogging would have to be absolute "
"to stop the flow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting.rst:48
msgid ""
"The failure was that the water traveling horizontally in the branches and"
" trunk carries air bubbles to the vertically downward flowing pipe (see a"
" photo here). The air accumulates in that pipe and the water falls "
"through the air losing energy like a waterfall. Water completely stops "
"flowing through the layers of the filter that exit through that trunk "
"line when the height of the air is equal to the available energy driving "
"water through the StaRS filter."

"There are two improvements required at El PODA. First, the transmission "
"line must be operated with downstream flow control to prevent air "
"entrapment and compression. That will likely be sufficient to solve the "
"problem of air in the filters. The second improvement is to add manual "
"air release valves to the top of each of the trunk lines so that operates"
" can expel air during filtration. Note that these air vents must have a "
"valve that is closed during backwash because the filter is under negative"
" pressure during backwash and would suck air into the filter through "
"those vents if they were open."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting.rst:52
msgid ""
"EStaRS with the wing inlets make a possible failure mode. At the end of "
"the backwash if the operator closes the valve in the siphon quickly, the "
"water pressure rises quickly inside the filter. When the water rises in "
"the three entry passages it is possible that the water carries the sand "
"inside the branches with wings. And once there is sand inside the pipes, "
"this sand may hinder the flow of water during the filter run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting.rst:54
msgid ""
"The solution is in the operation of the system and maybe a change in the "
"design. If the operators are manipulating pipe stubs to do the backwash, "
"then the first step is to remove the pipe stubs before closing the valve."
" The other way around the problem would be to close the valve slowly to "
"ensure that the water rises very slowly in the inlets."
