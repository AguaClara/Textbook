"Although we don’t require that you use the nomenclature from the "
"AguaClara variable naming guide, it provides a reasonable basis for "
"organizing your variable names. We use the convention that the first part"
" of the variable name describes the type of variable and always has a "
"unique dimension. The subsequent parts of the variable name start from "
"the big picture and slowly add more and more detail to arrive at the "
"precise component that you are describing. Thus space_floc_baffle is the "
"spacing between baffles in the flocculator and n_floc_channel_baffle "
"should be the number of baffles in a flocculator channel. "
"width_floc_channel_port should be the width of the port connecting two "
"flocculator channels."
