"\"If the water is dirty, then filter it.\" That is a common "
"misunderstanding of what we should do if the water is dirty. And that "
"misunderstanding has led to many, many failures of water treatment "
"technologies. There are slow sand filters and multistage filters "
"abandoned in many corners of Honduras. The first AguaClara plant at "
"Marcala, Honduras was built in an abandoned filtration plant. In many "
"cases the failed filters were installed in locations where the raw water "
"carried far too much sediment to be treated by filtration. This common "
"misunderstanding of the capabilities of sand filters has a long history."

"Starting in 1829 surface water treatment plants in England used slow sand"
" filters. Decades later in 1885 they discovered that slow sand filters "
"actually remove bacteria. That was quite a surprise given that the pores "
"in slow sand filters are perhaps 50 times larger than the bacteria that "
"they remove! Clearly filters were doing something more interesting than "
"simply straining out particles that were bigger than the pores."

"Slow sand filtration ran into big trouble when they were installed in "
"cities along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the United States. The "
"high sediment load carried by those rivers could not be removed using "
"slow sand filters. The need to treat water with high sediment loads (high"
" turbidities) led to the innovation of coupling flocculation, "
"sedimentation, and a new kind of filter - rapid sand filters. The early "
"emphasis on filtration as the primary process persisted and continues "
"even today. For example, the surface water treatment plant that provides "
"drinking water to the Cornell University campus is called Cornell Water "
"Filtration Plant."

"The process that removes most of the particles in the Cornell Water "
"Filtration Plant is the sedimentation tank with big assistance from the "
"flocculators. The rapid sand filters are a polishing step that removes "
"approximately 1 NTU or about 1 mg/L of solids. This is not to diminish "
"the importance of filtration. After all, this chapter is all about "
"filtration. The goal is to put filtration in context and remind all of us"
" that both slow and rapid sand filters are limited to polishing water "
"that is already very clean."

"Slow sand filters are sometimes called bio filters, a misunderstanding "
"that has persisted from the early observations that biofilms grow (or are"
" imported) in the sand bed. Although biofilms do form in slow sand "
"filters it is unlikely that they play a role in particle removal. Weber-"
"Shirk demonstrated that removal of E. coli by slow sand filters was "
"insignificant even when the filters had 1 m of head loss due to biofilm "
"growth. Weber-Shirk also demonstrated that slow sand filters perform well"
" even when poisoned with azide. Weber-Shirk also demonstrated that "
"predation by a small protozoan, a chrysophyte, can play a role in the "
"removal of bacteria. The chrysophyte is too small to ingest protozoan "
"pathogens such as cryptosporidium or Giardia lamblia and thus those "
"organisms are likely only removed by physical-chemical means. Similarly "
"it is unlikely that the chrysophyte wastes energy on ingesting virus "
"particles. The dominant particle removal mechanism in slow sand filters "
"is physical-chemical and is the same mechanisms at work in rapid sand "
"filters. Naturally occurring aluminum creates sticky surfaces in the sand"
" bed and makes some of the influent particles sticky. It is likely that "
"aluminum content in the raw water plays a significant role in slow sand "
"filter performance. The aluminum hydroxide nanoparticle \"glue\" is "
"likely able to effect the removal of a wide range of particle sizes."

"Slow sand filters remove the majority of the particles in the top cm of "

"forms on top of the sand and this layer of dirt causes the majority of "
"the head loss thru the filter bed. It is this thin layer that is removed "
"when the head loss is too high to achieve the desired flow rate through "
"the filter. Most slow sand filters are cleaned by hand using shovels to "
"remove a thin layer of the schmutzdecke. The cleaning process is labor "

"Multistage filters were invented to extend the range of applicability of "
"slow sand filters. Slow sand filters were viewed as an appropriate "
"technology for rural communities, but their very limited ability to treat"
" water with suspended solids made them inappropriate for communities that"
" have surface water sources with high turbidity during runoff events. "
"Roughing filters made with various sizes of gravel were added to remove "
"sediment. The roughing filters were essentially inefficient sedimentation"
" tanks with 60% of their volume occupied by rocks! Roughing filters were "
"also difficult to clean and without using coagulants their particle "
"removal efficiency was poor. Nonetheless, multistage filters have been "
"built in many rural communities in Latin America."

"It is always interesting to try to understand why different technologies "
"were invented and specifically what problem they were trying to solve. "
"One possibility is that goal was to reduce the labor required for "
"cleaning slow sand filters by devising a system to clean the sand in "
"place. Given the idea of fluidizing the bed of sand with a high upflow "
"velocity it then became tempting evolve to higher flow rates during "
"filtration because having to clean the filter frequently was no longer a "
"problem. Another possibility is that rapid sand filters were invented to "
"handle higher turbidity water, but that isn't supported by the "
"capabilities of rapid sand filters. Slow and rapid sand filters have very"
" similar maximum influent water turbidity limits. Thus the real advantage"
" to rapid sand filters is that they can be cleaned quickly."

"Many rapid sand filters use 2 or 3 different densities and sizes of "
"filter media to achieve a system with large pores at the surface of the "
"filter and smaller pores deeper within the filter. If sand with a wide "
"range of sizes is fluidized the small sand grains quickly rise to the top"
" and the large sand grains fall to the bottom. Thus a poorly sieved sand "
"will have small pores at the top and large pores at the bottom after "
"backwash. The trick to creating a mix of filter media that results in big"
" pores on the top is to use low density, large diameter media with a "
"lower terminal velocity than a higher density, small diameter media. "
"During backwash the less dense media ends up on top and thus this reverse"
" stratification is achieved."

"Given that many installed rapid sand filters are dual media it is worth "
"reflecting on what problem the dual media filters are designed to solve. "
"One possible problem is surface clogging of the sand filter when large, "
"strong flocs bridge across sand pores and then support a layer of flocs "
"above the sand bed. This surface layer would be similar to the "
"schmutzdecke in slow sand filters and could be the location of "
"significant head loss. It appears that rapid sand filters do suffer from "
"surface clogging in some instances. Of course, it is possible that this "
"failure is related to the use of flocculent aids that result in "
"excessively strong flocs and/or sedimentation tanks that don't "
"effectively capture large flocs."

"Additional potential benefits of dual media filtration include the "
"possibility that they can hold a larger mass of particles before "
"requiring backwash or that they may be able to achieve higher particle "
"removal efficiency. `Zouboulis et al. "
"<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2006.02.102>`_ compared single and dual "
"media filtration and demonstrated that the main advantage to dual media "
"filtration was that it had a lower rate of head loss accumulation. Given "
"that the rate of increase of head loss for the dual media filters was "
"constant over time suggests that the pores that were doing the filtration"
" were exclusively in the larger of the two media. This suggests that "
"larger diameter media (rather than dual media) might be a better choice "
"for rapid sand filters."

"Dual media filters face more challenges during cleaning. The use of "
"relatively low density media for the top layer results in a lower density"
" fluidized bed. This lower density fluidized bed makes it possible for "
"flocs to form mudballs that are sufficiently dense to fall through the "
"top layer of media during backwash (page 221 of Water and Wastewater "
"Technology, 6th edition, by Hammer and Hammer, 2008). The formation of "
"these mudballs is one of the reasons that dual media filters use air "
"scour before or during backwash to breakup the mudballs."

"Rapid sand filters rely on a backwash system.  It takes a relatively high"
" velocity of water to fluidize a bed of sand and that water has to come "
"from somewhere. In conventional water treatment plants that water comes "
"from a clearwell that is filled with filtered water. During backwash "
"water from the clearwell is pumped through the filter and then either "
"wasted or returned to the head of the plant for another pass through the "
"treatment processes. The need for pumps is one of the big disadvantages "
"of conventional rapid sand filters. Conventional rapid sand filters fail "
"if they lose power or if there isn't enough filtered water in the "
"clearwell when the filter needs to be backwashed. This raises an "
"interesting question about how rapid sand filters are initially "
"commissioned at water treatment plants given that the clearwell is "
"initially empty and given that filters MUST BE FILLED WITH WATER FROM THE"
" BOTTOM. If you dump water on top of a dry filter bed the water will "
"create a few paths down through the sand and the majority of the sand "
"pores will remain filled with air even when the level of water floods the"
" top of the filter bed. Thus the first operation in rapid sand filter "
"startup must be backwash!"

" layers of sand (no dual media here) with the layers stacked vertically. "
"The six layers give a total sand depth of 1.2 m. The filter operates with"
" the same design flow rate for both backwash and filtration modes and "
