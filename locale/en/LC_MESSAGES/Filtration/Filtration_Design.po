"Have the siphon manifold exit straight through the side of the filter "
"(perhaps in line with the other inlets and outlets) and then elbow up to "
"the required elevation and elbow and Tee back down again. This would make"
" the siphon install inside the filter be a single straight pipe instead "
"of the large assembly that is currently used. This will have the "
"additional advantage that the connection between this drain manifold and "
"the pipe stub in the wall doesn't have to be leak tight! The connection "
"could be a wrap of stainless steel and two hose clamps."

"The trunks are constrained to both provide similar flow to each filter "
"layer and to provide similar flow to each branch within the sand bed. "
"Providing the same flow to each filter layer during filtration is the key"
" constraint that determines the size of the trunk lines. The most "
"challenging flow distribution is between middle inlets that carry flow "
"for two layers and the top and bottom inlets that carry flow for one sand"
" layer. This flow distribution is ensured by making the head loss through"
" the outer inlet trunks to be equal to the head loss through the inner "
"inlet trunks when the outer inlet trunks have 1/2 the flow of the inner "
"inlet trunks."

"The flow distribution within the filter bed to ensure complete "
"fluidization of the sand bed during backwash can be achieved by "
"increasing the head loss through the flow control orifices in the "
"branches. Calculating this required head loss is the second step in "
"designing the filter inlet piping."
