"This textbook represents our cumulative insights from our journey that "
"has been motivated by a quest to make the world a better place where "
"everyone has access to safe water on tap, the engineering challenge of "
"optimizing the design of drinking water treatment plants, and the "
"curiosity to understand what controls their performance. We would like to"
" understand what determines which contaminants make it the whole way "
"through a water treatment plant. If we could understand what allows some "
"contaminants to sneak the whole way through a water treatment plant, then"
" we suspect that we could create better designs to more effectively "
"remove contaminants."

"Engineering textbooks provide a venue for authors to share what they've "

"The assumption that what is written and passed down in oral history "
"through the scientific community is true can lead to missed opportunities"
" and lost insights. The hypotheses from one generation of scientists can "
"too easily evolve into new theories in the next generation and then into "
"established theories for the next. The history of drinking water "

"miss or misrepresent key concepts."

"You might wonder why we care so much about getting the science right and "
"being as clear as possible about what is known. After all, the core "
"drinking water treatment technologies were invented before we were born "
"and many of us have safe drinking water coming from our taps. "
"Environmental Engineers have known how to design municipal drinking water"
" treatment plants since they early 1900's. We care about getting the "
"science right because we hypothesize that there are many opportunities to"
" significantly improve drinking water treatment technologies and that "
"improved understandings of each unit process have the potential to lead "

"Our contention is that no one has ever optimized the design of a drinking"
" water treatment plant! We are reasonably certain of this because we "
"don't yet have models (with equations) that describe performance of most "
"of the core unit processes (rapid mix, flocculation, floc blankets, "
"sedimentation, sand filtration) used for surface water treatment. The "
"only possible exception is lamellar sedimentation which can be "
"characterized if we know the size and density distribution of the "
"particles entering the sedimentation tank."

#: ../../Introduction/Introduction.rst:27
msgid ""
"Traditional drinking water treatment textbooks can too easily miss the "
"opportunity to advance the science of drinking water treatment "
"technologies by presenting certainty where there should be skepticism. "
"For example, rapid mix is described as process that occurs in a few "
"seconds, flocculation is described as a process that should be fastest "
"for high turbidity waters and slowest for low turbidity waters, and "
"filtration performance is described by a model that predicts first order "
"removal with respect to filter bed depth. We will demonstrate why each of"
" these assumptions doesn't match observations, we will discuss new "
"insights into these processes, and we will identify high priority "
"research questions that have the potential to lead to major improvements "

"We want to encourage skepticism and we want to develop insights to guide "

"to measure over a very wide range of particle concentrations (perhaps 10 "
":math:`\\mu g/L` to 1 :math:`g/L`). The test doesn't require any reagents"
" and it can be done in a flow through sample cell for real time "

"Dramatically different designs are also created when we choose gravity "

"AguaClara plants have a layout that places the coagulant dose controls "
"within a few steps of the best places to observe floc formation in the "
"flocculator. This provides plant operators with rapid feedback that is "
"critical when the raw water changes rapidly at the beginning of a high "
"runoff event. As operators spend time observing the processes in the "
"plant they begin to associate cause and effect and can make operational "
"changes to improve performance. For example, gas bubbles that carry flocs"
" to the surface can indicate sludge accumulation in a sedimentation tank."
" Rising flocs without gas bubbles can indicate a poor inlet flow "
"distribution for a sedimentation tank or density differences caused by "
"temperature differences."
