"This section contains the derivation of the minor loss equation using the"

"simplified energy equation across the control volume shown. Our energy "
"equation begins with :math:`h_P` and :math:`h_T` having been eliminated."

"Since the elevations at the center of the :math:`in` and :math:`out` "
"control surfaces are the same, we can eliminate :math:`z_{in}` and "
":math:`z_{out}`. As we are considering such a small length of pipe, we "
"will neglect the major loss component of head loss. Thus, :math:`h_L = "
"h_e + \\cancel{h_f}`. The following three equations are all the same, "
"simply rearranged to solve for :math:`h_e`."

"This last equation has :math:`h_e` as a function of four variables "
":math:`(p_{in}, \\, p_{out}, \\, v_{in}`, and :math:`v_{out})`; we would "
"like it to be a function of only one. Thus, we will invoke conservation "
"of momentum in the horizontal direction across our control volume to "
"remove variables. The difference in momentum from the :math:`in` point to"
" the :math:`out` point is driven by the pressure difference between each "
"end of the control volume. We will be considering the pressure at the "
"centroid of our control surfaces, and we will neglect shear along the "
"pipe walls. After these assumptions, our momentum equation becomes the "
"following:"

"Recall that momentum is mass times velocity for solids, :math:`m v`, with"
" units of :math:`\\frac{[M][L]}{[T]}`. Since we consider water flowing "
"through a pipe, there is not one singular mass or one singular velocity. "
"Instead, there is a mass flow rate, or a mass per time indicated by "
":math:`\\dot m = \\rho Q`, which has units of :math:`\\frac{[M]}{[T]}`. "
"Therefore, the momentum for a fluid is :math:`\\rho Q \\bar v`. Applying "
"the continuity Equation :math:`Q = \\bar v A`, we get to the following "
"equation for the momentum of a fluid flowing through a pipe which we will"
" use in this derivation, :math:`M = \\rho \\bar v^2 A`. The pressure "
"force is simply the pressure at the centroid of the flow multiplied by "
"the area the pressure is acting upon, :math:`p A`."

"To ensure correct sign convention, we will make each side of the equation"
" negative for reasons discussed shortly. Since :math:`\\bar v_{in} > "
"\\bar v_{out}`, the left hand side will be :math:`M_{out} - M_{in}` in "
"order to be negative. The reduction in velocity from :math:`in` to "
":math:`out` causes an increase in pressure, therefore :math:`p_{in} - "
"p_{out}` is negative. With these substitutions, the conservation of "
"momentum equation becomes as follows:"

"Note that the area term attached to :math:`p_{in}` is actually "
":math:`A_{out}` instead of :math:`A_{in}`, as one might think. This is "
"because :math:`A_{out} = A_{in}`. We chose our control volume to start a "
"few millimeters into the larger pipe, which means that the cross-"
"sectional area does not change over the course of the control volume."

"Dividing both sides of the equation by :math:`A_{out} \\rho g`, we obtain"
