"This text is a collaborative effort involving hundreds of people. "
"Innovation requires collisions of ideas and the AguaClara program was "
"designed to foster global and multidisciplinary interactions between "
"students, faculty, field engineers, plant operators, implementation "
"partner organizations, and community members. These interactions have "
"provided a continuous and rich source of ideas that make it clear that in"
" a social network it is impossible for anyone to claim ownership of an "
"idea. Thus the inventions, equations, and reactor designs that are "
"described in this text are the product of a large, collaborative, open-"
"source community and none of us can claim that we are the sole authors. "
"The list of authors below have contributed directly to this text."
