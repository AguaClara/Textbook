"The previous analysis provides a minimum distance for sufficient mixing "
"so that equal mass flux of coagulant will end up in both treatment "
"trains. This assumes that the coagulant was injected in the pipe "
"centerline. Injection at the wall of the pipe is a poor practice and "
"would require many more pipe diameters because it takes significant time "
"for the coagulant to be mixed out of the slower fluid at the wall. The "
"time required for mixing at the scale of the flow in the plant is thus "
"accomplished in a few seconds. This ends up being the fastest part of the"
" transport of the coagulant nanoparticles on their way to attachment to "
"the clay particles.  Next we will determine a typical flow rate of "
"coagulant. **Aluminum** concentrations for polyaluminum chloride (PACl) "

"We can estimate the diameter of the injection port by setting the kinetic"
" energy loss where the coagulant is injected into the main flow to be "
"large enough to exceed the pressure fluctuations downstream of the LFOM. "
"The amount of energy we invest in injecting the coagulant into the raw "
"water is a compromise between having to raise the entire chemical feed "
"system including the stock tanks to increase the potential energy and a "
"goal of not having pressure fluctuations inside the LFOM pipe cause flow "
"oscillations in the chemical dosing tube. Thus our goal is to have the "
"kinetic energy at the injection point be large compared with the expected"
" pressure fluctuations in the LFOM. Given that the head loss through the "
"LFOM is often 20 cm, we expect the pressure fluctuations from turbulence "
"to be a small fraction of that head loss. Thus we set the kinetic energy "
"to be equivalent to 2 cm."
