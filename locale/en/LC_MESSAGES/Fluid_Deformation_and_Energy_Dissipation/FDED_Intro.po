":math:`G`, or velocity gradient, is a measure of fluid deformation. It is"

"comparison to another point on another streamline (:math:`v_A` compared "

":math:`\\varepsilon`, or energy dissipation rate, is the rate that the "

"useful concept because the last step of converting kinetic energy into "
"heat is accomplished by viscosity (:math:`\\nu`). This kinetic energy "
"being dissipated by viscosity is the energy associated with velocity "
"gradients (:math:`G`). Thus, through EDR there is a direct connection "
"between :math:`\\nu` and :math:`G`. This connection will be further "
