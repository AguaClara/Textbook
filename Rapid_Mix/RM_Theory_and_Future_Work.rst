Equations for :math:`\varepsilon` and :math:`G` in Varying Flow Geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimation of velocity gradients for various flow geometries is the
basis for the design of rapid mix, flocculators, and plate settlers.
Thus, our goal is to define the velocity gradients consistently across a
range of possible flow regimes. There are three approaches to
calculating the average velocity gradient within a control volume. 1)
Use the Navier Stokes equations and solve for the spatially averaged
velocity gradient. 1) Use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to solve
for the spatially averaged velocity gradient. 1) Use the total
mechanical energy loss in the control volume to calculate the energy
dissipation rate. Estimate the velocity gradient directly from the
energy dissipation rate,
:math:`G_{CS} = \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon}{\nu}}`, as defined by Camp
and Stein in 1943 (Camp, T. R., and Stein, P. C. (1943) ‘‘Velocity
Gradients and Hydraulic Work in Fluid Motion,’’ J. Boston Soc. Civil
Eng., 30, 203–221.).

The first approach would be ideal but is difficult in practice because
Navier Stokes solutions are only available for limited geometries and
laminar flow. CFD could be used but is difficult to use as a general
engineering design approach given the large number of geometries that
are used in drinking water treatment plants. For these reasons we will
use the control volume approach to estimate the average velocity
gradient. This method incorrectly assumes that the energy dissipation
rate is completely uniform in the control volume and hence the velocity
gradient is also uniform. This method results in an over estimation of
the velocity gradient.

The Camp-Stein estimate of :math:`G_{CS}` is based on a control volume
where the velocity gradient is uniform. Consider a layer of fluid of
depth :math:`H` and apply a velocity, :math:`v` at the top of the fluid.
The velocity gradient, :math:`G`, is thus :math:`\frac{v}{H}` everywhere
in the fluid. The force required to move the top of the fluid at
velocity v can be obtained from the required shear, :math:`\tau`. From
Newtons Law of Friction we have

.. math:: \tau = \mu \frac{v}{H} = \mu G = \nu\rho G

Where :math:`\tau` is the force required per unit plan view area. The
power per unit area required to move the fluid at velocity :math:`v` is
:math:`\tau v`. The mass per unit area is :math:`\rho H`. Thus the
energy dissipation rate or the power per mass is

.. math:: \varepsilon = \frac{P}{m} = \frac{\tau v}{\rho H} = \frac{\nu \rho G v}{\rho H} = \nu G^2

This equation has no approximations, but has one very important
assumption. We derived this equation for a control volume where the
velocity gradient was **uniform**. The reactors and control volumes that
we will be using as we design water treatment plants will **not** have
uniform velocity gradients. Indeed, several of the water treatment
processes will be turbulent and thus the velocity gradients in the fluid
will vary in both space and time. Even in laminar flow in a pipe the
velocity gradient is far from uniform with high velocity gradients at
the wall and zero velocity gradient at the center of the pipe.

We’d like to know if we can apply the previous equation

.. math:: \varepsilon = \nu G^2

to the case where the energy dissipation rate and velocity gradients are
nonuniform by simply introducing average values of both quantities.

.. math:: \bar\varepsilon \overset{?}{=} \nu \bar G^2

We will test this option with a simple case. Consider a hypothetical
reactor (case 2) that is 4 times as large in plan view area as the
uniform velocity gradient case explored above (case 1). In addition,
assume that 3/4 of the reactor has a velocity gradient of zero. The
average energy dissipation rate for case 1 is

.. math:: \bar \varepsilon_1 = \frac{P_1}{m_1} =  \nu \bar G_1^2

The average energy dissipation rate for case 2 is

.. math:: \bar \varepsilon_2 = \frac{P_1}{4m_1} = \frac{\bar \varepsilon_1}{4}

This makes sense because we are putting in the same amount of energy
into a control volume that is 4 times bigger.

Now we calculate the velocity gradients. As previously determined,

.. math:: \bar G_1 = \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon_1}{\nu}}

The average velocity gradient in the second control volume is simply the
volume weighted average

.. math:: \bar G_2 = \bar G_1\frac{1}{4}+ 0 \frac{3}{4}

where 1/4 of the case 2 control volume has the same velocity gradient
as the case 1 control volume and 3/4 of the control volume has a
velocity gradient of 0. The Camp Stein method would suggest that
:math:`\bar G_2` is equal to

.. math:: \bar G_2 \overset{?}{=} \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon_2}{\nu}}= \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon_1}{4\nu}}

Now we check to see if the Camp Stein method of estimating the average
velocity gradient, :math:`\bar G`, is correct.

.. math:: \bar G_2 = \frac{\bar G_1}{4} \neq \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon_1}{4\nu}} =  \frac{\bar G_1}{2}

Given that the energy dissipation rate is proportional to the square of
the velocity gradient the mean of the energy dissipation rate is **not**
proportional to the mean of the velocity gradient. Thus the Camp Stein
method of calculating the average velocity gradient is not correct
except in the case of uniform velocity gradient. The Camp Stein equation
is dimensionally correct and could be corrected by adding a
dimensionless constant :math:`\Pi_{CS}` that is a function of the energy
dissipation rate distribution within the control volume.

.. math:: \bar G =\Pi_{CS}\sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon}{\nu}}

where :math:`\Pi_{CS}` is 1 for a uniform velocity gradient and is less
than one for non uniform velocity gradients. We can think
:math:`\Pi_{CS}` as a measure of the efficiency of using energy to
deform the fluid. We can calculate :math:`\Pi_{CS}` for cases where we
have either a Navier Stokes or a computation fluid dynamics estimate of
:math:`\bar G`.

The conventional approach to design of flocculators uses the Camp Stein
definition of

.. math:: G_{CS} = \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon}{\nu}}

where :math:`G_{CS}` is **not** the average velocity gradient, but is
larger than the average velocity gradient by a factor of
:math:`\Pi_{CS}`. Thus we have

.. math:: G_{CS} = \Pi_{CS}\bar G

Use of the Camp Stein velocity gradient in design of mixing units and
flocculators results in an error when applying results from one reactor
to another. If the energy dissipation rate distribution within the
reactors is different, then :math:`\Pi_{CS}` will be different for the
two reactors and the actual average velocity gradient, :math:`\bar G`
will be different for the two reactors.

Given that energy is used more efficiently to produce velocity gradients
if the velocity gradients are uniform, our goal is to design mixing and
flocculation units that have relatively uniform velocity gradients. If
all of our reactors at both research scale and municipal scale have
similar values of :math:`\Pi_{CS}`, then we can use the Camp Stein
definition of :math:`G_{CS}` and not introduce any significant errors.
It will not be reasonable, however, to expect similar performance based
on similar values of :math:`G_{CS}` if one reactor has relatively
uniform energy dissipation rates and the other reactor has zones with
very high energy dissipation rates and zones with very low energy
dissipation rates.

We will demonstrate later that mechanically mixed reactors typically
have a much wider range of energy dissipation rates than do well
designed hydraulically mixed reactors. Thus comparisons between
mechanically mixed and hydraulically mixed reactors must account for
differences in :math:`\Pi_{CS}`.

We will use the Camp Stein definition
:math:`G_{CS} = \sqrt{\frac{\bar\varepsilon}{\nu}}` as the design
parameter of convenience in this textbook.

equations describing head loss, energy dissipation rates, and velocity
gradients in various flow geometries that are commonly encountered in
water treatment plants.

   \bar\varepsilon = \frac{gh_{\rm{L}}}{\theta} \qquad\qquad
   G_{CS} = \sqrt{\frac{\bar \varepsilon}{\nu}} \qquad\qquad
   \bar v=\frac{4Q}{\pi D}

Note that the velocity gradient is independent of viscosity (and hence
temperature) for laminar flow. This is because the total amount of fluid
deformation is simply based on geometry. The no slip condition, the
diameter, and the length of the flow passage set the total fluid
deformation. Of course, if temperature decreases and viscosity increases
the amount of energy required to push the fluid through the flow passage
will increase (head loss is proportional to viscosity for laminar flow).

For turbulent flow and for flow expansions the amount of fluid
deformation decreases as the viscosity increases and the total energy
required to send the flow through the reactor is almost independent of
the viscosity. The “almost” is because for wall shear under turbulent
conditions there is a small effect of viscosity that is buried inside
the friction factor.

mass of fluid in the control volume \* :math:`\rlap{-}V` = volume of the

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our understanding of rapid mix is currently quite speculative. This is
an area that requires substantial research. We have anecdotal evidence
that the process of transporting coagulant nanoparticles to suspended
particle surfaces may be a slow, rate-limiting process. Dissolved
organic matter may influence the rate of coagulant nanoparticle
transport by effectively increasing the size of the coagulant
nanoparticles and thus reducing the diffusion rate.

Developing a fundamental understanding of the mixing and transport
processes that occur between coagulant addition and flocculation is a
very high priority for the AguaClara program.

Estimates of time required for mixing processes
-----------------------------------------------

Turbulent mixing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Large scale eddies at the dimension of flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step in mixing is at the large scale of the dimension of the
largest eddies where the dimension of the largest eddies is the smallest
dimension normal to the direction of flow. Thus in a pipe the dimension
of the largest eddies is set by the pipe diameter. In a open channel the
dimension of the largest eddies is usually the water depth although it
could be the width of the channel for the case of a narrow tall channel.

We can use the eddy velocity to estimate how long it will take for an
eddy to cross the smallest dimension of flow. Eddy velocity is
:math:`v_{eddy} \approx \left( \bar\varepsilon \, L_{eddy} \right)^\frac{1}{3}`.
The “:math:`\approx`” indicates that this relationship is the same order
of magnitude. In a pipe we have

.. math:: v_{eddy} \approx \left( \bar\varepsilon \, D \right)^\frac{1}{3}

For a long straight pipe
:math:`\bar\varepsilon = \frac{{\rm f}}{2} \frac{\bar v^3}{D}` and thus
we can obtain the ratio between mean velocity and the velocity of the
large scale eddies.

.. math:: v_{eddy} \approx \left( \frac{{\rm f}}{2} \frac{\bar v^3}{D} \, D \right)^\frac{1}{3}

.. math:: \frac{v_{eddy}}{\bar v} \approx \left( \frac{{\rm f}}{2}   \right)^\frac{1}{3}

Given a friction factor of 0.02, the eddy velocity is approximately 20%
of the mean velocity. We can use this ratio to estimate how many pipe
diameters downstream from an injection point will the coagulant be mixed
across the diameter of the pipe.

.. math::  N_{D_{pipe}} \approx \frac{\bar v}{v_{eddy}} \approx \left(\frac{2}{{\rm f}} \right)^\frac{1}{3}

Where :math:`N_{D_{pipe}}` is the distance in number of pipe diameters
downstream of the injection point where complete mixing will have
occurred. This estimate is a minimum distance and a factor of safety of
2 or more would reasonably be applied. In addition it is best practice
to inject the coagulant in the center of the pipe. Injecting the
coagulant at the side of the pipe will require considerably greater
distance downstream for mixing across the pipe.

.. code:: python

    print((0.02/2)**(1/3))

Inner viscous length scale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The smallest scale at which inertia containing eddies causes mixing is
set by the final damping of inertia by viscosity. Turbulence occurs when
fluid inertia is too large to be damped by viscosity. The ratio of
inertia to viscosity is given by the Reynolds number, :math:`\rm Re`:

.. math:: {\rm{Re}} = \frac{\bar vD}{\nu}

 Flows with high Reynolds numbers are turbulent (inertia dominated) and
with low Reynolds are laminar (viscosity dominated). The transition
Reynolds number is a function of the flow geometry and the velocity and
length scale that are used to characterize the flow. In all turbulent
flows there is a length scale at which inertia finally loses to
viscosity. The scale where viscosity wins is some multiple of the
Kolmogorov length scale, which is defined as:

.. math:: \eta_K = \left( \frac{\nu^3}{\varepsilon} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}

where :math:`\eta_K` is the Kolmogorov length scale. At the Kolmogorov
length scale viscosity completely dampens the inertia of the eddies and
effectively “kills” the turbulence.

The length scale at which most of the kinetic energy contained in the
small eddies is dissipated by viscosity is the inner viscous length
scale, :math:`\lambda_v`, which is about `50 times larger
than <http://dimotakis.caltech.edu/pdf/Dimotakis_JFM2000.pdf>`__ the
Kolmogorov length scale. Thus we have

.. math:: \lambda_\nu = \Pi_{K\nu}\left( \frac{\nu^3}{\varepsilon} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}

 {#eq:inner_viscous_length}

where :math:`\Pi_{K\nu} = 50`

At length scales larger than the inner viscous length scale,
:math:`\lambda_v`, the dominant transport mechanism is by turbulent
eddies. At length scales smaller than :math:`\lambda_v` the dominant
transport mechanism is fluid deformation due to shear. If the flow
regime is completely laminar such as in a small diameter tube
flocculator, then the dominant transport mechanism is fluid deformation
due to shear at length scales all the way up to the diameter of the
tubing.

The dividing line between eddy transport and fluid deformation
controlled by viscosity can be calculated as a function of the energy
dissipation rate using [@eq:inner_viscous_length].

millimeters for energy dissipation rates used in rapid mix units and

Turbulent mixing time as a function of scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are searching for the rate limiting step in the mixing process as we
transition from the scale of the flow down to the scale of the coagulant
nanoparticles. We can estimate the time required for eddies to mix at
their length scales by assuming that the eddies pass all of their energy
to smaller scales in the time it takes for an eddy to travel the
distance equal to the length scale of the eddy. This time is known as
the **`eddy turnover
time <http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/eac20/cee637/handouts/TURBFLOW_1.pdf>`__**,
:math:`t_{eddy}`. `The derivation for the equation below is found
here <https://github.com/AguaClara/CEE4540_Master/blob/master/AguaClara%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant%20Design/Rapid%20Mix/RM_Derivations.md#t_eddy>`__.

.. math:: t_{eddy} \approx \left( \frac{L_{eddy}^2}{ \bar\varepsilon }\right)^\frac{1}{3}

We can plot the eddy turnover time as a function of scale from the inner
viscous length scale up to the scale of the flow. We will discover
whether large scale mixing by eddies is faster or slower than small
scale mixing by eddies.

**Figure x:** Eddy turnover times as a function of length scale for a
range of energy dissipation rates.

The eddy turnover times are longest for the largest eddies and this
analysis suggests that it only takes a few seconds for turbulent eddies
to mix from the scale of the flow down to the inner viscous length
scale.

The large scale mixing time is critical for the design of water
treatment plants for the case where the flow is split into multiple
treatment trains after coagulant addition. In this case it is critical
that the coagulant be mixed equally between all of the treatment trains
and thus the mixing times shown in the previous graph represent a
minimum time between where the coagulant is added and where the flow is
divided into the parallel treatment trains.

It is likely this process of mixing from the scale of the flow down to
the inner viscous length scale is commonly referred to as “rapid mix.”
Here we showed that this mixing is indeed rapid and is really only a
concern in the case where the coagulant injection point is very close to
the location where the flow is split into multiple treatment trains.

Shear-diffusion transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the first few seconds in which mixing occurs from the length scale
of the flow down to the inner viscous length scale the next step in the
transport process is blending of the coagulant uniformly with the raw
water. At the end of the turbulent transport the coagulant stock has
been stretched out into thin bands throughout the raw water, but the two
fluids are not actually blended together by turbulence. The blending is
accomplished by fluid deformation and then by molecular diffusion.

Fluid deformation by Shear
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time scale for fluid deformation is :math:`1/G` where :math:`G` is
the velocity gradient. This simple relationship is because the velocity
of fluid deformation is proportional to the length scale and thus the
time to travel any given distance is always the same. Velocity gradients
in conventional mechanized rapid mix units are order 1000 Hz and thus
the time for fluid deformation to blur concentration gradients is
approximately 1 ms. This confirms the idea that blending the coagulant
with the raw water is actually a very fast process with the slowest
phase being the transport by turbulent eddies at the scale of reactor.

Einstein’s diffusion equation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can estimate the length scale at which fluid shear and diffusion
provide transport at the same rate. Einstein’s diffusion equation is

.. math:: D_{Diffusion} = \frac{k_B T}{3 \pi \mu d_P}

where :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and :math:`d_P` is the
diameter of the particle that is diffusion in a fluid with viscosity
:math:`\nu` and density :math:`\rho`. The diffusion coefficient
:math:`D_{Diffusion}` has dimensions of :math:`\frac{[L^2]}{[T]}` and
can be understood as the velocity of the particle multiplied by the
length of the mean free path.

From dimensional analysis the time for diffusion to blur a concentration
gradient over a length scale, :math:`L_{Diffusion}` is

.. math:: t_{Diffusion} \approx \frac{L_{Diffusion}^2}{D_{Diffusion}}

The shear time scale is :math:`1/G` and thus we can solve for the length
scale at which diffusion and shear have equivalent transport rates.

.. math::  1/G \approx t_{Diffusion} \approx \frac{L_{Diffusion}^2}{D_{Diffusion}}

Substitute Einstein’s diffusion equation and solve for the length scale
that transitions between shear and diffusion transport.

.. math:: L_{Diffusion}^{Shear} \approx \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{3 G \pi \mu  d_P}}

.. code:: python

    def L_Shear_Diffusion(G,Temperature,d_particle):
      return np.sqrt((u.boltzmann_constant*Temperature/
      (3 * G *  np.pi *pc.viscosity_dynamic(Temperature)* d_particle)).to_base_units())

    G = 100*u.Hz
    d_particle = fm.PACl.Diameter*u.m
    x = (L_Shear_Diffusion(G,Temperature,d_particle)).to(u.nm)
    print(x)

Molecular diffusion finishes the blending process by transporting the
coagulant nanoparticles the last few hundred nanometers. The entire
mixing process from the coagulant injection point to uniform blending
with the raw water takes only a few seconds.

We have demonstrated that all of the steps for mixing of the coagulant
nanoparticles with the raw water are very fast. Compared with the time
required for flocculation, 10s to 1000s of seconds, the time required
for this mixing is insignificant. The remaining steps are: 1. Molecular
diffusion causes some dissolved species and Al nanoparticles to
aggregate. 1. Fluid shear and molecular diffusion cause Al nanoparticles
with attached formerly dissolved species to collide with inorganic
particles (such as clay) and organic particles (such as viruses,
bacteria, and protozoans).

Length scales of coagulant nanoparticles and clay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The coagulant nanoparticles eventually will attach to clay particles.
The clay particles have a diameter of approximately
:math:`5 \, {\rm \mu m}` and thus it is clear from the length scale in
the figure above that turbulent eddies aren’t able to transport all the
way to attachment to clay.

Diffusion and Shear Transport Coagulant Nanoparticles to Clay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time required for shear and diffusion to transport coagulant
nanoparticles to clay has previously been assumed to be a rapid process.
The

-  Diffusion blends the coagulant with the raw water sufficiently so
   that the coagulant precipitates and forms nanoparticles.
-  Dissolved organic molecules diffuse to the coagulant nanoparticles
   and adhere to the nanoparticle surface.
-  The coagulant nanoparticles are transported to suspended particle
   surfaces by a combination of diffusion and fluid shear.

The following is a very preliminary estimate of the time required for
attachment of the nanoparticles to the clay particles. This analysis
includes multiple simplifying assumptions and there is a reasonable
possibility that some of those assumptions are wrong. However, the core
assumptions that coagulant nanoparticles are transported to clay
particles by a combination of fluid deformation (shear) and molecular
diffusion is reasonable.

The volume of the suspension that is cleared of nanoparticles is
proportional to a collision area defined by a ring around the clay
particle with width of the diameter of the nanoparticle diffusion band.
This diffusion band is the length scale over which diffusion is able to
transport coagulant particles to the clay surface during the time that
the nanoparticles are sliding past the clay particle.

.. math::  \propto \pi \, d_{Clay} \, L_{Diff_{NC}}

 The volume cleared is proportional to time

.. math::  \propto t

 The volume cleared is proportional to the relative velocity between
clay and nanoparticles. This scaling

.. math::  \propto v_r

.. math::  \bar v_{\rm{Cleared}} = \pi  d_{Clay} \, L_{Diff_{NC}}  v_r  t

Use dimensional analysis to get a relative velocity for the long range
transport controlled by shear.

.. math:: v_r = f \left( \varepsilon ,\nu ,\Lambda_{Clay} \right)

.. math:: v_r = \Lambda_{Clay} f \left( \varepsilon ,\nu \right)

.. math:: v_r \approx \Lambda_{Clay} G

.. math::

   \Lambda_{Clay} = [L]
   \, \, \, \, \, \, \,
   \varepsilon = \frac{[L]^2}{[T]^3}
   \, \, \, \, \, \, \,
   \nu = \frac{[L]^2}{[T]}

Diffusion band thickness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Figure x:** The time required for shear to transport all of the fluid
past the clay so that diffusion can transport the coagulant
nanoparticles to the clay surface is significant.

.. math:: D_{Diffusion} = \frac{k_B T}{3 \pi \, \mu \, d_P}

.. math:: L_{Diff} \approx \sqrt{D_{Diffusion} t_{Diffusion}}

The time for nanoparticles to diffuse through the boundary layer around
the clay particle is equal to the distance they travel around the clay
particle divided by their velocity. The distance they travel scales with
:math:`d_{Clay}` and their average velocity scales with the thickness of
the diffusion layer/2 \* the velocity gradient.

.. math:: t_{Diffusion} = \frac{ 2d_{Clay}} {L_{Diff} G}

.. math:: L_{Diff} \approx \left( \frac{2k_B T d_{Clay}}{3 \pi \,\mu  \, d_{NC} G}\right)^\frac{1}{3}

Let’s estimate the thickness of the diffusion band

.. code:: python

    T_graph = np.linspace(0,30,4)*u.degC
    G = np.arange(50,5000,50)*u.Hz

    def L_Diff(Temperature,G):
      return (((2*u.boltzmann_constant*Temperature * fm.Clay.Diameter*u.m)/(3 * np.pi *pc.viscosity_dynamic(Temperature)* (fm.PACl.Diameter*u.m)*G))**(1/3)).to_base_units()

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for i in range(len(T_graph)):
      ax.semilogx(G,L_Diff(T_graph[i],G).to(u.nm))

**Figure x:**

Using the equation for :math:`L_{Diff}` above, `we can solve
for <https://github.com/AguaClara/CEE4540_Master/blob/master/AguaClara%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant%20Design/Rapid%20Mix/RM_Derivations.md#t_coagulant%20application>`__
the time required to reach a target efficiency of application of
coagulant nanoparticles to clay:

.. math:: t_{coagulant, \, application} = \frac{2.3p C_{NC} \, \Lambda_{Clay}^2}{\pi G k \, d_{Clay}\,  L_{Diff_{NC}} }

The time required for the coagulant to be transported to clay surfaces
is strongly dependent on the turbidity as indicated by the average
spacing of clay particles, :math:`\Lambda_{Clay}`. As turbidity
increases the spacing between clay particles decreases and the time
required for shear to transport coagulant nanoparticles to the clay
decreases. Increasing the shear also results in faster transport of the
coagulant nanoparticles to clay surfaces. The times required are
strongly influenced by the size of the coagulant nanoparticles because
larger nanoparticles diffuse more slowly.

Below we estimate the time required to achieve 80% attachment of
nanoparticles in a 10 NTU clay suspension.

Energy tradeoff for coagulant transport

    plt.show()

**Figure x:** The total energy required to attach coagulant
nanoparticles to raw water inorganic particles increases rapidly with
the velocity gradient used in the rapid mix process.

There is often a tradeoff between reactor volume and energy input. The
reactor volume results in a higher capital cost and the energy input
requires both higher operating costs and higher capital costs. This
provides an opportunity to optimize rapid mix design once we have a
confirmed model characterizing the process.

The total potential energy used to operate an AguaClara plant is
approximately 2 m. This represents the difference in elevation between
where the raw water enters the plant and where the filtered water exits
the plant. If we assume that the rapid mix energy budget is a fraction
of that total and thus for subsequent analysis we will assume somewhat
arbitrarily that the energy available to attach the coagulant
nanoparticles to the raw water particles is 50 cm.

According to the analysis above, the maximum velocity gradient that can
be used to achieve 80% coagulant nanoparticle attachment using only 20
cm of head loss is 142 Hz. This requires a residence time of 100
seconds. These model results must be experimentally verified and it is
very likely that the model will need to be modified.

The analysis of the time required for shear and diffusion to transport
the coagulant nanoparticles the last few millimeters suggests that it is
this last step that requires the most time. Indeed, the time required
for coagulant nanoparticle attachment to raw water particles is
comparable to the time that will be required for the next step in the
processs, flocculation.

Coagulant attachment mechanism
------------------------------

-  Surface charge neutralization hypothesis

   -  coagulant nanoparticles attach to each other
   -

-  Polar bonds

   -  Electronegativity reveals that the aluminum - oxygen bond is more
      polar than the hydrogen - oxygen bond
   -  The bond between a coagulant nanoparticle and a clay surface can
      potentially be stronger than the bond between a water molecule and
      the clay surface.

Jet Mixing
~~~~~~~~~~

In both mixing for the application of coagulant nanoparticles and for
flocculation we have the goal of deforming the fluid to facilitate
collisions between particles. As engineers we need to design reactors
that deform the fluid. There are several approaches \* coiled tube
flocculators (laminar flow) \* rotating propellers \* hydraulic jet

Coiled tube flocculators are commonly used by AguaClara Cornell
researchers for small laboratory scale (a few mL/s) experiments.

[add equations here for coiled flocculators]

Conventional Rapid Mix

Maximum velocity gradients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    Mix_HRT = np.array([0.5,15,25,35,85])*u.s
    Mix_G = np.array([4000,1500,950,850,750])/u.s
    Mix_CP = np.multiply(Mix_HRT, np.sqrt(Mix_G))
    Mix_Gt = np.multiply(Mix_HRT, Mix_G)
    Mix_EDR = (Mix_G**2*pc.viscosity_kinematic(Temperature))

    fig.savefig(imagepath+'Mechanical_RM_Gt')
    plt.show()

**Figure x:** Mechanical rapid mix units use a wide range of velocity
gradients and residence times.

Conventional rapid mix units use mechanical or potential energy to
generate intense turbulence to begin the mixing process. Conventional
design is based on the use of :math:`\bar G` (an average velocity
gradient) as a design parameter. We don’t yet know what the design
objective is for rapid mix and thus it isn’t clear which parameters
matter. We hypothesize that both velocity gradients that cause
deformation of the fluid and time for molecular diffusion are required
to ultimately transport coagulant nanoparticles to the surfaces of clay
particles.

The velocity gradient can be obtained from the rate at which mechanical
energy is being dissipated and converted to heat by viscosity.

.. math::  \varepsilon = G^2 \nu

where :math:`\varepsilon` is the energy dissipation rate, :math:`G` is
the velocity gradient, and :math:`\nu` is the kinematic viscosity of
water. We can estimate the power input required to create a target
energy dissipation rate for a conventional design by noting that power
is simple the energy dissipation rate times the mass of water in the
rapid mix unit.

.. math:: P = \bar\varepsilon \rlap{-}V \rho

.. math::  P = \bar G^2 \nu \rlap{-}V \rho

We can relate reactor volume to a hydraulic residence time,
:math:`\theta`, and volumetric flow rate, Q.

.. math::  P = \rho \bar G^2 \nu Q \theta

This equation is perfectly useful for estimating electrical motor sizing
requirements for mechanical rapid mix units. For gravity powered
hydraulic rapid mix units it would be more intuitive to use the change
in water surface elevation, :math:`\Delta h` instead of power input.

.. math:: P = \rho g Q \Delta h

Combining the two equations we obtain.

.. math::   \Delta h =   \frac{G^2 \nu \theta}{g}

Typical values for residence time and average velocity gradient are
given below.

Rotating propellers can either be installed in open tanks or enclosed in
pipes. From a mixing and fluids perspective it doesn’t make any
difference whether the tank is open to the atmosphere or not. The
parameters of interest are the rate of fluid deformation and the
residence time in the mixing zone.
