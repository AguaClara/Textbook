## Publishing
To publish, first ensure all of your changes have been merged into master by following the Pull Request best practices [here](https://github.com/AguaClara/Textbook/wiki/Contributing-by-writing). Then follow these steps:

1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull`
3. `git tag <tagname>`
   1. To get `<tagname>`, check the latest release and increment by 1, following semantic versioning. For Example, if the current version were `v0.0.76` and there were only small edits the next would be `v0.0.77`. If there were more significant changes it would be `v0.1.0`, and for extremely large changes (maybe a whole new chapter?), `v1.0.0`.
4. `git push origin <tagname>`

Pushing a tag will kick off the automated release workflow which builds the PDF and HTML documentation.
# Technical Reports
We are using [sphinx_ext_substitution](https://github.com/NordicHPC/sphinx_ext_substitution)  to replace keywords. This enables accessing the last part of the map to find a specific variable. For example, $..lfom.rowN, will find all of the variables where the map ends with lfom.rowN. If more than one option is available sphinx_ext_substitution will throw an error. The solution is to add more detail to the map name and perhaps specify the entrance tank or filter.

Each plantâ€™s technical report will live in its own repository in the [AguaClara Reach github](https://github.com/AguaClara-Reach). The plant repository main branch will contain all of the data needed to create the technical report. 
1. plant.yml
2. index.rst
The gh-pages branch will have the html files and folder structure
