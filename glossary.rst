    Eddy, "The swirling of a fluid in turbulent flow that moves in a direction different from the surrounding flow."
    Energy Dissipation Rate, "The amount of energy lost from viscous forces in turbulent flow; equivalent to head loss in a reactor."
    Floc, "A cluster of colloidal particles formed through collision and adhesion in the processes of coagulation and flocculation."
    Floc Filter, "A fluidized layer of flocs that is maintained in the bottom of an upflow clarifier."
    Floc Hopper, "The collection area in a clarifier where flocs accumulate after overflowing from the floc filter."
    Fractal, "A geometric structure in which each part shares the characteristics of the whole, forming the same pattern at any scale."

    Head Loss, "Reduction in the energy of a fluid as it flows through a system, including major and minor losses."
    Hydraulic Head, "The energy of an incompressible fluid expressed as a unit of length representing the height of the fluid in an equivalent static column; the sum of the pressure and elevation terms in the energy equation."

    Major Loss, "Energy lost through friction between a fluid and material surfaces."
    Minor Loss, "Energy lost through the expansion of flow, often pipe fittings."
    Obstacles, "Obstructions formed by half-pipes that were created by AguaClara to add extra head loss between baffles in a flocculator channel, which makes it possible to design smaller flocculators without compromising efficiency."

    Shear, "A type of fluid flow where parallel layers move at different speeds."
    Streamline, "A line that is parallel to the local velocity vector at all points; the path that a particle would take if it could be placed in the fluid without changing the original flow."
    Suspension, "A heterogeneous fluid mixture containing particles that are large enough for sedimentation to occur."
    Sutro Weir, "A rectangular overflow dam sides that curve parabolically outward at the base causing discharge flow to be proportional to head; also referred to as a proportional weir."
