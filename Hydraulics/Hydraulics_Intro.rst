Hydraulics Introduction
********************************************

The hydraulic controls provide the basis for efficient and robust water treatment plant operation. Water must move through unit processes and between unit processes and the flow passages must be designed to meet various constraints. One constraint is that water that is carrying a significant amount of sediment (flocculator and sedimentation tank inlet) must have sufficient velocity and turbulence levels to minimize sedimentation.  A more challenging constraint is that the flow must be divided equally between parallel processes. Flow distribution through parallel paths is a key hydraulic design constraint for all municipal scale water treatment plants. The parallel path constraint only goes away for laboratory scale processes where there is a single tube settler and a filter with a single layer of sand.

    The flow through a sedimentation tank is analogous to an electrical circuit with wires and resistors. Identical resistors in parallel paths help improve flow distribution between the paths. Differences in piezometric head (think voltage) in the manifolds that connect the paralle
