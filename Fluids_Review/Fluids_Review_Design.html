<p>Welcome to the <strong>first</strong> summary sheet of CEE 4540! These documents will
be guides and references for you throughout the semester. Since
Professor Monroe’s class time is limited, so too is the amount of
material he can fit on the slides while ensuring that they remain
understandable. Thus, these summary sheets will supplement the
powerpoints by going into further detail on the course concepts
introduced in the slides.</p>
<p>Equations, universal constants, and other helpful goodies can be found
in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AguaClara/aide_design/tree/master/aide_design">aide_design repository on
GitHub</a>.
Most equations and constants you find in these summary sheets will
already have been coded into aide_design, and will be shown here in the
following format:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Variable: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.gravity</span></code></div>
<div class="line">Function: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.area_circle(DiamCircle)</span></code>.</div>
</div>
<p>The letters before the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code>, in this case <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc</span></code>, indicate the file
within aide_design where the variable or function can be found. In the
examples above, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.gravity</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.area_circle(DiamCircle)</span></code> show
that the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gravity</span></code> and function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">area_circle(DiamCicle)</span></code>
are located inside the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/AguaClara/aide_design/blob/master/aide_design/physchem.py">physchem.py</a>
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc</span></code>) file. You are strongly recommended to look up any aide_design
equations you plan to use within in their aide_design file before using
them, even if they are given here in this summary sheet. This is because
each equation has comments in its original file describing what the
specific conditions are to using it.</p>
<p>For the most part, <a class="reference external" href="http://likethis.com/">hyperlinks in these documents will contain
supplementary information</a>. The information
contained in the linked external sites is there in case you don’t feel
completely comfortable with a concept, but is not necessary to learn
thoroughly and will not be tested.</p>

<h2>1.2. Introductory Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#introductory-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before diving in, there are a few important concepts which will be the
foundation for building your understanding of fluid mechanics. One must
walk before they can run, and similarly, the basics of fluid mechanics
must be understood before moving on to the more fun sections of this
document.</p>
<div class="section" id="continuity-equation">
<h3>1.2.1. Continuity Equation<a class="headerlink" href="#continuity-equation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Continuity is simply an application of mass balance to fluid mechanics.
It states that the cross sectional area <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> that a fluid flows
through multiplied by the fluid’s average flow velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v\)</span>
must equal the fluid’s flow rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-0">
<span class="eqno">(1.1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-0" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[Q = \bar v A\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The line above the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> is called a ‘bar,’ and represents an average. Any variable can have a bar. In this case, we are adding the bar to velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>, turning it into average velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v\)</span>. This variable is pronounced ‘v bar.’</p>
</div>
<p>In CEE 4540, we deal primarily with flow through pipes. For a circular pipe, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A = \pi r^2\)</span>. Substituting diameter in for radius, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = \frac{D}{2}\)</span>, we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\)</span>. You will often see this form of the continuity equation being used to relate the flow rate in a pipe to the fluid velocity and pipe diameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-1">
<span class="eqno">(1.2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-1" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[Q = \bar v \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The continuity equation is also useful when flow is going from one geometry to another. In this case, the flow in one geometry must be the same as the flow in the other, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_1 = Q_2\)</span>, which yields the following equations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-2">
<span class="eqno">(1.3)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-2" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\bar v_1 A_1 = \bar v_2 A_2\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-3">
<span class="eqno">(1.4)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-3" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\bar v_1 \frac{\pi D_1^2}{4} = \bar v_2 \frac{\pi D_2^2}{4}\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Such that:</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q =\)</span> fluid flow rate</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v =\)</span> fluid average velocity</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A =\)</span> pipe area</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r =\)</span> pipe radius</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D =\)</span> pipe diameter</div>
</div>
<p>An example of changing flow geometries is when the a change in pipe size occurs in a circular piping system, as is demonstrated below. The flow through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm pipe} \, 1\)</span> must be the same as the flow through <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm pipe} \, 2\)</span>.</p>

<h3>1.2.2. Laminar and Turbulent Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#laminar-and-turbulent-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Considering that this class deals with the flow of water through a water treatment plant, understanding the characteristics of the flow is very important. Thus, it is necessary to understand the most common characteristic of fluid flow: whether it is laminar or turbulent. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow">Laminar</a> flow is very smooth and highly ordered. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence">Turbulent</a> flow is chaotic, messy, and disordered. The best way to understand each flow and what it looks like is visually, <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/qtvVN2qt968?t=131">like in this video</a> or the wikipedia image below. Please ignore the part of the video after the image of the tap.</p>

</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A numeric way to determine whether flow is laminar or turbulent is by finding the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number">Reynolds number</a>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rm Re}\)</span>. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless parameter that compares inertia, represented by the average flow velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v\)</span> times a length scale <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity">viscosity</a>, represented by the kinematic viscosity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVQw0svRHZA">Click here</a> for a brief video explanation of viscosity. If the Reynolds number is less than 2,100 the flow is considered laminar. If it is more than a certain value, it is considered turbulent.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-4">
<span class="eqno">(1.5)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-4" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[{\rm Re = \frac{inertia}{viscosity}} = \frac{\bar vD}{\nu}\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar%E2%80%93turbulent_transition">There is a transition between laminar and turbulent flow which is not yet well understood</a>. To simplify this phenomenon and make it possible to code for laminar or turbulent flow, we assume that the transition occurs at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm{Re} = 2100\)</span>. The flow regime is assumed to be laminar below this value and turbulent above it. This variable is coded into aide_design as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.RE_TRANSITION_PIPE</span></code>. We will neglect transitional flow.</p>
<p>Fluid can flow through very many different geometries like a pipe, a rectangular channel, or any other shape. To account for this, the characteristic length scale is quantified as the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/hydraulic-equivalent-diameter-d_458.html">hydraulic diameter</a>, which can be applied to any geometry. For circular pipes, which are the most common geometry you’ll encounter in this class, the hydraulic diameter is simply the pipe diameter.</p>
<p>Here are other commonly used forms of the Reynolds number equation. They are the same as the one above, just with the substitutions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q = \bar v \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}\)</span></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Laminar and turbulent flow are described as two different
<strong>flow regimes</strong>. When there is a characteristic of flow and different
categories of the characteristic, each category is referred to as a flow
regime. For example, the Reynolds number describes a flow
characteristic, and its categories, referred to as flow regimes, are
laminar or turbulent.</p>
<div class="section" id="streamlines-and-control-volumes">
<h4>1.2.2.1. Streamlines and Control Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="#streamlines-and-control-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Both
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines">streamlines</a>
and <strong>control volumes</strong> are tools to compare different sections of a
system. For this class, this system will always be hydraulic.</p>
<p>Imagine water flowing through a pipe. A streamline is the path that a
particle would take if it could be placed in the fluid without changing
the original flow of the fluid. A more technical definition is “a line
which is everywhere parallel to the local velocity vector.”
Computational tools, <a class="reference external" href="https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&amp;image_host=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuclear-power.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F05%2FFlow-Regime.png%3F4b884b&amp;u=https://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Flow-Regime.png?4b884b">dyes (in
water)</a>,
or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ZSAX56m0E&amp;t=59s">smoke (in
air)</a> can be used
to visualize streamlines.</p>
<p>A control volume is just an imaginary 3-dimensional shape in space. Its
boundaries can be placed anywhere by the person applying the control
volume, and once set the boundaries remain fixed in space over time.
These boundaries are usually chosen to compare two relevant surfaces to
each other. The entirety of a control volume is usually not shown, as it
is often unnecessary. This is shown in the following image:</p>
<center></center><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Many images will be used over the course of this
class to show hydraulic systems. A standardized system of lines will be
used throughout them all to distinguish reference elevations from
control volumes from streamlines. This system is described in the image
below.</p>

<h3>1.2.3. The Bernoulli and Energy Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bernoulli-and-energy-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As explained in CEE 3310 with more details than most of you wanted to
know, the Bernoulli and energy equations are incredibly useful in
understanding the transfer of the fluid’s energy throughout a streamline
or through a control volume. The Bernoulli equation applies to two
different points along one streamline, whereas the energy equation
applies across a control volume. The energy of a fluid has three forms:
pressure, potential (deriving from elevation), and kinetic (deriving
from velocity).</p>

<p>Notice that each term in this form of the Bernoulli equation has units
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([L]\)</span>, even though the terms represent the energy of water,
which has units of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{[M] \cdot [L]^2}{[T]^2}\)</span>. When energy of
water is described in units of length, the term used is called <strong>head</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two important distinctions to keep in mind when using head to
talk about energy. First is that head is dependent on the density of the
fluid under consideration. Take mercury, for example, which is around
13.6 times more dense than water. 1 meter of mercury head is therefore
equivalent to around 13.6 meters of water head. Second is that head is
independent of the amount of fluid being considered, <em>as long as all the
fluid is the same density</em>. Thus, raising 1 liter of water up by one
meter and raising 100 liters of water up by one meter are both
equivalent to giving the water 1 meter of water head, even though it
requires 100 times more energy to raise the hundred liters than to raise
the single liter. Since we are concerned mainly with water in this
class, we will refer to ‘water head’ simply as ‘head’.</p>
<p>Going back to the Bernoulli equation, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{p}{\rho g}\)</span> term
is called the pressure head, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> the elevation head, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{v^2}{2g}\)</span> the velocity head. The following diagram shows
these various forms of head via a 1 meter deep bucket (left) and a jet
of water shooting out of the ground (right).</p>

the main one for the purpose of this class is that energy is not gained

precise fluid mechanics terminology, then “friction by viscous forces
must be negligible.” What this means is that the fluid along the
streamline being considered is not losing energy to viscosity. Energy
can only be transferred between its three forms if this equation is to
be used, it can’t be gained or lost.</p>

<p>The assumption necessary to use the Bernoulli equation, which is stated

the energy equation for the purpose of this class. The energy equation
accounts for the (L)oss of energy from both the fluid flowing,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L\)</span>, and any other energy drain, like the charging of a

In the Bernoulli equation, the velocity of the streamline of water is
considered, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>. The energy equation, however compares control
surfaces instead of streamlines, and the velocities across a control
surface many not all be the same. Hence, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v\)</span> is used to
represent the average velocity. Since AguaClara does not use pumps nor
turbines, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_P = h_T = 0\)</span>. With these simplifications, the energy
equation can be written as follows:</p>

<p><strong>This is the form of the energy equation that you will see over and
over again in CEE 4540.</strong> To summarize, the main difference between the
Bernoulli equation and the energy equation for the purposes of this
class is energy loss. The energy equation accounts for the fluid’s loss
of energy over time while the Bernoulli equation does not. So how can
the fluid lose energy?</p>

<h3>1.2.4. Head Loss<a class="headerlink" href="#head-loss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Head (L)oss</strong>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L\)</span> is a term that is ubiquitous in both this
class and fluid mechanics in general. Its definition is exactly as it
sounds: it refers to the loss of energy of a fluid as it flows through
space. There are two components to head loss: major losses caused by
pipe-fluid (f)riction, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{\rm{f}}\)</span>, and minor losses caused by
fluid-fluid friction resulting from flow (e)xpansions, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_e\)</span>, such
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L = h_{\rm{f}} + h_e\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="major-losses">
<h4>1.2.4.1. Major Losses<a class="headerlink" href="#major-losses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>These losses are the result of friction between the fluid and the
surface over which the fluid is flowing. A force acting parallel to a
surface is referred to as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_force">shear</a>. It can therefore
be said that major losses are the result of shear between the fluid and
the surface it’s flowing over. To help in understanding major losses,
consider the following example: imagine, as you have so often in physics
class, pushing a large box across the ground. Friction is what resists
your efforts to push the box. The farther you push the box, the more
energy you expend pushing against friction. The same is true for water
moving through a pipe, where water is analogous to the box you want to
move, the pipe is similar to the floor that provides the friction, and
the major losses of the water through the pipe is analogous to the
energy <strong>you</strong> expend by pushing the box.</p>
<p>In this class, we will be dealing primarily with major losses in
circular pipes, as opposed to channels or pipes with other geometries.
Fortunately for us, Henry Darcy and Julius Weisbach came up with a handy
equation to determine the major losses in a circular pipe <em>under both
laminar and turbulent flow conditions</em>. Their equation is logically but
unoriginally named the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%E2%80%93Weisbach_equation">Darcy-Weisbach

<p>Darcy-Weisbach is wonderful because it applies to both laminar and
turbulent flow regimes and contains relatively easy to measure
variables. The one exception is the Darcy friction factor,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rm{f}\)</span>. This parameter is an approximation for the magnitude of
friction between the pipe walls and the fluid, and its value changes
depending on the whether or not the flow is laminar or turbulent, and
varies with the Reynolds number in both flow regimes.</p>
<p>For laminar flow, the friction factor can be determined from the
following equation:</p>

<p>The significance of this equation lies in its relationship between
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{\rm{f}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>. Hagen-Poiseuille shows that the terms
are directly proportional (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{\rm{f}} \propto Q\)</span>) during laminar

square of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> during turbulent flow
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{\rm{f}} \propto Q^2\)</span>). As you will soon see, minor losses,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_e\)</span>, will grow with the square of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> in both laminar and
turbulent flow. This has implications that will be discussed later, in

<h4>1.2.4.2. Minor Losses<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-losses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple ‘pushing a box across the ground’
example to explain minor losses. So instead, consider a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5spXXZX55C8">hydraulic
jump</a>. In the video, you
can see lots of turbulence and eddies in the transition region between
the fast, shallow flow and the slow, deep flow. The high amount of
mixing of the water in the transition region of the hydraulic jump
results in significant friction <em>between water and water</em> (recall that
the measure of a fluid’s resistance to internal, fluid-fluid friction is
called <strong>viscosity</strong>). This turbulent, eddy-induced, fluid-fluid
friction results in minor losses, much like fluid-pipe friction results
in major losses.</p>
<p>As is the case in a hydraulic jump, a flow expansion (from shallow flow
to deep flow) creates the turbulent eddies that result in minor losses.
This will be a recurring theme in throughout the course: <strong>minor losses
are caused by flow expansions</strong>. Imagine a pipe fitting that connects a
small diameter pipe to a large diameter one, as shown in the image
below. The flow must expand to fill up the entire large diameter pipe.
This expansion creates turbulent eddies near the union between the small
and large pipes, and these eddies cause minor losses. You may already
know the equation for minor losses, but understanding where it comes
from is very important for effective AguaClara plant design. For this
reason, you are strongly recommended to read through the full
derivation, in <a class="reference internal" href="Fluids_Review_Derivations.html#fluids-review-derivations"><span class="std std-ref">Fluids Review Derivations</span></a>.</p>

<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(in\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(out\)</span> subscripts in each of the three forms
refer to the diagram that was used for the derivation:</p>
<center></center><p>The second and third forms are the ones which you are probably most
familiar with. The distinction between them, however, is critical.
First, consider the magnitudes of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{in}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{out}\)</span>.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{in}\)</span> can never be larger than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{out}\)</span>, because the
flow is expanding. When flow expands, the cross-sectional area it flows
through must increase. As a result, both
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{A_{out}}{A_{in}} &gt; 1\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{A_{in}}{A_{out}} &lt; 1\)</span> must always be true. This means that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K^{'}\)</span> can never be greater than 1, while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> technically
has no upper limit.</p>
<p>If you have taken CEE 3310, you have seen tables of minor loss
coefficients <a class="reference external" href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/minor-loss-coefficients-pipes-d_626.html">like this
one</a>,
and they almost all have coefficients greater than 1. This implies that
these tables use the third form of the minor loss equation as we have
defined it, where the velocity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out}\)</span>. There is a good
reason for using the third form over the second one:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out}\)</span> is far easier to determine than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{in}\)</span>. Consider flow through a pipe elbow, as shown in the
image below.</p>
<center></center><p>In order to find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out}\)</span>, we first need to know which point
is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(out\)</span> and which point is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(in\)</span>. A simple way to
distinguish the two points is that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(in\)</span> occurs when the flow is
most contracted, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(out\)</span> occurs when the flow has fully expanded
after that maximal contraction. Going on these guidelines, point ‘B’
above would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(in\)</span>, since it represents the most contracted flow
in the elbow-pipe system. Therefore point ‘C’ would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(out\)</span>, as
it is the point where the flow has fully expanded after its compression
in ‘B.’</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out}\)</span> is easy to determine because it is the velocity of
the fluid as it flows through the entire area of the pipe. Thus,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out}\)</span> can be found with the continuity equation, since
the flow through the pipe and its diameter are easy to measure,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{out} = \frac{4 Q}{\pi D^2}\)</span>. On the other hand,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{in}\)</span> is difficult to find, as the area of the contracted
flow is dependent on the exact geometry of the elbow. This is why the
third form of the minor loss equation, as we have defined it, is the
most common.</p>

of water, the elevation difference is called the <strong>driving head</strong>. In
the system above, the driving head is the elevation difference between
the water level and the end of the tubing. Usually driving head is
written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta z\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta h\)</span>, though above it is
labelled as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>This image is violating the energy equation by saying that the elevation
difference between the water in the tank and the end of the tube is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_L\)</span>. It implies that all of the driving head, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta z\)</span>,
is lost to head loss and therefore that no water is flowing out of the
tubing, which is not true. Let’s apply the energy equation between the
two red points. Pressures are atmospheric at both points and the
velocity of water at the top of tank is negligible.</p>

<h3>1.2.6. The Orifice Equation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-orifice-equation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This equation is one that you’ll see again and again throughout this
class. Understanding it now will be invaluable, as future concepts will
use and build on this equation.</p>
<div class="section" id="vena-contracta">
<h4>1.2.6.1. Vena Contracta<a class="headerlink" href="#vena-contracta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before describing the equation, we must first understand the concept of
a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_contracta">vena contracta</a>.
Refer once more to this image of flow through a pipe elbow.</p>
<center></center><p>The flow contracts as the fluid moves from point ‘A’ to point ‘B.’ This
happens because the fluid can’t make a sharp turn at the corner of the
elbow. Instead, the streamline closest to the sharp turn makes a slow,
gradual change in direction, as shown in the image. As a result of this
gradual turn, the cross-sectional area the fluid is flowing through at
point ‘B’ is less than the cross-sectional area it flows through at
points ‘A’ and ‘C’. Written as an equation,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{csB} &lt; A_{csA} = A_{csC}\)</span>, where the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_{csA}\)</span> stands for
‘control surface <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’ subscript</p>
<p>The term ‘vena contracta’ describes the phenomenon of contracting flow
due to streamlines being unable to make sharp turns. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{vc}\)</span> is
a ratio between the flow area at the vena contracta, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{csB}\)</span>,
which is when the flow is <em>maximally</em> contracted, and the flow area
<em>before</em> the contraction, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{csA}\)</span>. In the image above, the
equation for the vena contracta coefficient would be:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-28">
<span class="eqno">(1.29)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fluids-review-fluids-review-design-28" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Pi_{vc} = \frac{A_{csB}}{A_{csA}}\]</div>
<p>Note that what this class calls <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{vc}\)</span> is often referred to as
a ‘Coefficient of Contraction,’ <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_c\)</span>, in other engineering
courses and settings. When the most extreme turn a streamline must make
is 90°, the value of the vena contracta coefficient is close to 0.62.
This parameter is in aide_design as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pc.RATIO_VC_ORIFICE</span></code>. The vena
contracta coefficient value is a function of the flow geometry.</p>
<p><strong>A vena contracta coefficient is not a minor loss coefficient.</strong> Though
the equations for the two both involve contracted and non-contracted
areas, these coefficients are not the same. Refer to the flow through a
pipe elbow image above. The minor loss coefficient equation uses the
areas of points ‘B’ and ‘C,’ while the vena contracta coefficient uses
the areas of points ‘A’ and ‘B.’ Additionally, the equations to
calculate the coefficients themselves are not the same. Confusing the
two coefficients is common mistake that this paragraph will hopefully
help you to avoid.</p>
