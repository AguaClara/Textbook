    :alt: Linear Flow Orifice Meter

    The Linear Flow Orifice Meter measures the flow of water through the plant and creates a linear relationship between plant flow rate and the depth of water in the entrance tank.

    :alt: Location of the Linear Flow Orifice Meter

    The Linear Flow Orifice Meter (outlined in red) is located in the entrance tank.

   "",""
   "Flow (L/s)", "The maximum flow rate sets the size of the Linear Flow Orifice Meter. Vary it to see how the dimensions change."
   "",""
   Minimum temperature (˚C), The flow is turbulent throughout the Linear Flow Orifice Meter and thus temperature doesn’t have a significant effect on the design.
   "",""
   Water elevation range (m), Change in water elevation in the entrance tank that corresponds to the flow varying from 0 L/s up to the maximum design flow rate.
   "",""
   Maximum drill diameter (m), Used to limit the drill bit size required to fabricate the LFOM.
   "",""
   Maximum nominal diameter (inch), Used to set a maximum pipe size. For higher flow rates the LFOM will increase the water elevation range so the pipe can carry more flow.
