# Textbook Structure
This is the first version attempted of an AguaClara textbook. The current proposed structure is as follows:

Each chapter will cover a unit process, like "Flow Control and Measurement" or "Sedimentation."

Each chapter will have the following three sections:
- Introduction
- Design
- Theory and Future Work

Each chapter may also have up to three appendices:
- Appendix A: Uncertainties
- Appendix B: Derivations
- Appendix C: Examples

**Active Questions:** Should the 'Uncertainties' appendix section be linked in with the 'Theory and Future Work' section? Would that make it too long? If the two sections should not be merged, then how should 'Uncertainties' and 'Derivations' be ordered? I am a proponent of pushing the 'EDR and G' chapter into the 'Theory and Future Work' section of the 'Rapid Mix' chapter.

## Introduction
The introduction contains two components:
- Introduces and explains concepts relevant to the physics and design of the unit process
- Covers briefly the design of conventional water treatment plants and how they solve the problems associated with the unit process.  

## Design
Contains the details of an AguaClara design for the unit process. Goes over logic and explains thoroughly why design decisions are made.

## Theory and Future Work
Contains working theories in the AguaClara lab and future research projects to better understand the physics of water treatment and improve plant design.

## Appendix A: Uncertainties
The physics of water treatment has not been figured out, not by AguaClara nor by anyone. Therefore, many of the numbers that AguaClara uses as its basis for design do not have ironclad physical reasons and are usually empirically based. Whenever an uncertain parameter, value, or concept is being discussed, it will show up in <font color="red">red font</font>. This parameter/value/concept's uncertainty will be additionally discussed in this section.

## Appendix B: Derivations
Many of the equations that show up in the `Introduction` and `Design` sections have lengthy derivations that have been done by AguaClara in the past. The step-by-step derivations of these equations will be found in this section. Equations that require derivations will be noted as such in the text and linked to their derivations.


## Appendix C: Examples
This section will contain example problems. A big portion of these example problems will be design challenges that were used in previous years, before this textbook was made available.


# Textbook Progress Table

Each chapter will have sections according to the [explanation](https://github.com/AguaClara/CEE4540_Master/tree/master/AguaClara%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant%20Design#textbook-structure) right below the table. To monitor the progress of each section, we will use the following table. Every cell will have an **Author**. Additionally, every cell will have one of the following statuses:

- **N/A**: Not applicable- not every section is relevant in every chapter
- **-**: Section not yet started
- **Preliminary writing**: Information has been written but is not organized and not in accordance with the textbook's syntax and structure.
- **Edits ongoing**: Relevant information has been written and is in the process of being made readable.  
- **Organized**: Information has been purposefully organized in a logical way and is presentable to readers.  
- **Reviewed**: Read and commented through by volunteers. The name of each reader is included.

### For Interested Reviewers
Sections that are marked as categorized as '**Organized**' are ready for your review. Comment on absolutely anything and everything that crosses your mind while reading in a GitHub issue [on this page](https://github.com/AguaClara/CEE4540_Master/issues). If the file you are reviewing already has an issue page, then *post your comments on that issue*. Only begin a new issue if the file you are looking at does not have one. If you begin a new issue, assign it to Juan (juanchon998), Monroe (monroews), and Clare (clare45).
