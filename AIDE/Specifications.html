<p>This document specifies the design goals, the raw water quality parameters, and the design and construction requirements for an AguaClara drinking water treatment plant. The plant will produce safe, potable drinking water from a source water that may be contaminated with particles, pathogens, and dissolved organics.</p>
<div class="section" id="aguaclara-plant-design-goals">
<h2>AguaClara Plant Design Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#aguaclara-plant-design-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>AguaClara drinking water treatment technologies remove turbidity and pathogens from raw water and to deactivate remaining pathogens before distribution. AguaClara technologies are best suited for centralized water treatment in communities of at least 200 people. AguaClara technologies would not be appropriate for treatment of low-turbidity groundwater where the primary contamination issues are chemical, such as nitrate or heavy metals. AguaClara technologies are gravity-driven and do not require electricity. When required by the topography, pumps can raise the source water to the elevation necessary for water treatment and water distribution.</p>
<p>AguaClara treatment technologies include chemical dosing, rapid mix, flocculation, floc filter, plate settlers, filtration, and disinfection. An AguaClara treatment plant may be designed with all of these processes, or if raw water turbidity is consistently less than about 3 NTU, the treatment plant may be designed without flocculation, floc filter, and plate settlers.</p>
<div class="section" id="water-quality-parameters">
<h3>Water Quality Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#water-quality-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The tables below summarize the raw water quality parameters for which AguaClara treatment technologies are appropriate.</p>

<p>AguaClara plants are only designed to treat the water quality parameters listed above. All other parameters should be within acceptable ranges in the raw water or should be treated by other means.</p>
<p>Before beginning construction of an AguaClara treatment plant, bench-scale jar testing should be performed to confirm that polyaluminum chloride or another proposed coagulant is able to successfully form flocs that settle.</p>

An equivalent device, such as a Sutro weir, can also be used if demonstrated to function equivalently.</p></li>
<li><p>The pattern of orifices shall be designed so that the water level in the entrance chamber (equal to the hydrostatic head pushing water through the offices) is linearly proportional to the total flow through the orifices (equal to the plant flow).

<li><p>To ensure that plant flow is measured with adequate resolution the water level should change a minimum of 20 cm from no flow to the design flow rate. Larger water level changes can be used to enable use of smaller diameter LFOMs.</p></li>

<li><p>Function</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The doser is designed so that the operator can select a chemical dose (mass of chemical per volume of water) by moving the dose slider to a specific position along the lever. The lever, LFOM and constant head tank then work together to adjust the chemical flow proportional to the plant flow to maintain a constant chemical dose.</p></li>
<li><p>When the plant flow is zero, the lever is horizontal and chemical flow is zero.</p></li>
<li><p>When plant flow increases, the water level in the entrance tank increases (due additional head loss through the LFOM), causing one end of the doser lever to rise. This, in turn, causes the other end of the lever, and the dose slider, to fall, increasing the elevation difference between the chemical level in the constant level tank and the dose slider. The greater driving head increases the chemical flow through the doser.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the entrance tank level (due to the LFOM) is directly proportional to the plant flow rate, the dose slider elevation is directly proportional to the entrance chamber level, and the chemical flow is directly proportional to the dose slider elevation, the chemical flow is directly proportional to the plant flow.</p></li>

<h2>Flocculator<a class="headerlink" href="#flocculator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The AguaClara flocculator is a hydraulic flocculator that can be designed as either a <strong>horizontal or vertical flocculator.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="design-goals">
<h3>Design Goals<a class="headerlink" href="#design-goals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AguaClara flocculator is designed with the following goals:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<h3>Influent Channel<a class="headerlink" href="#influent-channel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Flocculated water enters a pipe in the bottom of  the influent channel. Water flows down the pipe, through a 90-degree bend, into the influent manifold.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="influent-manifold">
<h3>Influent manifold<a class="headerlink" href="#influent-manifold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Water exits the influent manifold through a series of orifices and diffusers in the bottom of the pipe. The end of the influent manifold is capped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diffusers">
<h3>Diffusers<a class="headerlink" href="#diffusers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The orifices and diffusers point down to the bottom of the clarifier bay and extend along the length of the pipe at regular intervals to ensure that water is evenly distributed within the bay. Diffusers are designed <strong>to introduce 1 cm of head loss to uniformly increase the head loss through all flow paths in the sedimentation tank.</strong></p>
<p>Diffusers are shaped so that one end is a circular pipe that fits into the influent manifold orifice, and the other end is deformed to the shape of a thin rectangle. This deformation is done to create a line jet entering the jet reverser in the bottom of the clarifier bay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jet-reverser">
<h3>Jet reverser<a class="headerlink" href="#jet-reverser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The jet reverser consists of a longitudinally-cut half-pipe that is laid in the bottom of the bay. It functions as a way to keep flocs suspended in the sedimentation tank by ensuring that any sludge that settles will be propelled back up by the force of the diffuser jet.</p>
<p>The diffusers are offset from the jet reverser centerline. This is intentionally done to promote the resuspension of flocs, which form a floc filter for primary filtration.</p>

<h3>Floc filter (Floc Blanket)<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-filter-floc-blanket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Floc filters significantly improve the performance of a clarifier and reduce settled water.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The line jet from the diffusers enters the jet reverser to force flow up through the clarifier bay. The vertical upward jet momentum is used to resuspend flocs that have settled to the bottom of the clarifier bay. The resuspended flocs form a fluidized bed which is called a floc filter. The bed is fluidized because flocs are kept in suspension by the upflowing water.</p></li>
<li><p>For a floc filter to form, a clarifier requires that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All flocs are returned to the bottom of the clarifier bay.</p></li>
<li><p>All settled flocs are resuspended by incoming water.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="sloped-bottom-geometry">
<h3>Sloped bottom geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#sloped-bottom-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The clarifier bottom geometry prevents sludge accumulation while also ensuring good flow distribution. The slope on either side of the diffusers is at a 50 degree angle above horizontal. The bottom geometry allows for smooth flow expansion to the entire plan view area of the bay, and ensures that all flocs that settle are transported to the jet reverser. The diffusers do not touch the bottom of the tank so that flocs on both sides of the diffuser can fall into the jet reverser for resuspension. Thus, there is no accumulation of settled flocs in the main clarifier bays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="floc-hopper">
<h3>Floc Hopper<a class="headerlink" href="#floc-hopper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The floc hopper provides an opportunity for floc consolidation. The floc weir controls the depth of the floc filter because as the floc filter grows, it will eventually reach the top of the floc weir. Because flocs are more dense than water, the flocs “spill” over the edge of the floc weir which allows the floc filter to stay a constant height while sludge accumulates and consolidates in the floc hopper.</p>
<p>There is a manual valve at the drain of the floc hopper. Operators can open the floc hopper drain valve whenever they want to easily drain the sludge. The floc hopper allows for a self-cleaning clarifier. Operators only have to clean the clarifier once every three to six months because there is no stagnant accumulation of anoxic sludge.</p>

<div class="section" id="plate-settlers">
<h3>Plate Settlers<a class="headerlink" href="#plate-settlers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After flowing through the floc filter, flocs reach the plate settlers. Plate settlers are sloped surfaces that provide additional settling area for flocs, thereby increasing the effective settling area of the clarifier without increasing the plan view area. AguaClara plate settlers are sloped at 60 degrees. The spacing between plates is 2.5 cm.</p>
<p>The plate settlers are made from clear polycarbonate sheets. The sheets are assembled in modules. The modules are light enough to be removed from the clarifier by hand. The plate settler modules are supported by ledges along the clarifier bay walls and by a PVC pipe frame.</p>

<h3>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Stacked Rapid Sand, StaRS, filters were invented in 2010 by the AguaClara Cornell program in response to the need for a new technology that would both eliminate the need for backwash pumps and not require the construction of 6 filters for small towns. As shown in the figure below, StaRS filters use six 20 cm deep layers of sand with the layers stacked vertically. The six layers give a total active sand depth of 1.2 m.</p>

<h3>Filter Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#filter-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each layer of sand sits in between an inlet and outlet filter module. Each module consists of a large diameter trunk inlet/outlet pipe, which branches off into rows of smaller branch pipes. The branch pipes are supported along the filter walls by receptor pipes.</p>

<li><p>During filtration mode, water flows into the inlet filter modules through the inlet trunk and into the branches. Water flows out of the branches through small holes and into the sand layer.</p></li>
<li><p>During the transition from the backwash to filtration modes, water flows back into the inlet pipes. The “wings,” PVC pipes cut longitudinally are affixed to the inlet branches to prevent sand from flowing into the inlet pipe. Wings are only included on the inlet filter modules.</p></li>
