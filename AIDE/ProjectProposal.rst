Task 1.1.a Project Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project consists of the design and construction of a drinking water
treatment system to treat a surface water source using AguaClara
technology to supplement IP’s existing supply. IP will provide
regulatory limits and standards for the treated water. The required flow
rate will be verified during Phase 1.

The AguaClara treatment process design will include electricity-free
chemical feed of coagulant and chlorine, flocculation, clarification,
filtration, and disinfection. If required for water conservation, ACR
will provide a design for backwash recycling that will require a small
pump.

IP and ACR shall further update and refine thepurpose of this
project and itsrelation to system-wide water provisions following the
Kickoff Meeting.

`Task 1.2 <#p1tas_conditions%20assessment>`__\  Conditions Assessment
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Water Quality Monitoring and Testing

It would be ideal to have a year’s worth of turbidity and color
measurements prior to building a water treatment plant on a new water
source. ACR recognizes that extensive sampling is often not available
and thus the goal is to target sampling to minimize the risk of an
unexpected treatment challenge.

IP shall provide water quality analysis results for the raw water source
includingturbidity, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and dissolved organic
carbon for a minimum of 3 samples representing high turbidity events
following rainfall, baseflow conditions during the rainy season, and
baseflow conditions during the dry season. Any additional raw water
parameters that are also being tested for or monitored as part of the
existing facilities shall also be provided. ACR will not provide any
water quality testing equipment or analysis.

ACR shall provide guidance to IP to conduct jar tests on a minimum of
two samples representing low and high turbidity events.

-  ACR shall provide IP with a jar test method and recommend coagulants
   to be tested.
-  IP shallobtain water samples and chemical coagulants as required, and
   shallconduct the jar tests.
-  IP shall provide ACR with the test results, and ACR shall analyze the
   results.

Phase 2 - Design
================

The Design Phase will provide the Construction Documents required for
the Construction, Installation, Training, and Commissioning Phase.

The Design Phase will require close collaboration between IP and ACR to
ensure that the design meets the site constraints, is based on the
available generic materials, and addresses the water quality issues
identified in\ `Task 1.2 <#p1t_conditions%20assessment>`__\ .

.. _h.ay4b0pcu8528:

`Task 2.1 <#p2tas_personnel>`__\  Personnel Plan
------------------------------------------------

From the years of building AguaClara plants in Central America ACR has
identified four roles that are critical for their successful
implementation.

-  Structural engineer
-  Architect
-  Construction foreman
-  AguaClara technician

IP will be responsible for providing these staff who will learn the
details of AguaClara plant implementation during the design,
construction, and startup phases. The construction advisor and AguaClara
technician have specialized knowledge about the fabrication and
operation of AguaClara plants and the most effective way to transfer
that knowledge is to bring experienced staff from Agua Para el Pueblo
(APP) to work with the IP for the relevant phases of the project so that
they can advise the IP counterparts.

ACR and the IPwill determine the best mechanism to hireAPP staff and
bring them to work along side of IP staff. If required the IP will
provide a staff member who is fluent in Spanish to translate for the APP
staff.

.. _h.nhnfgxs7rqyf:

`Task 2.2 <#p2tas_key%20materials>`__\  Key Materials Selection and Sourcing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The corrugated polycarbonate sheets used for flocculator baffles and
plate settlers determine the width of individual clarifier bays. The
AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine can be quickly updated with
different dimensions for these sheets should that become necessary. IP
and ACR will work together to select the best source of these sheets.

ACR and IP will review the list of materials required for construction
and operation and determine if any materials need to be ordered before
Phase 3 begins and based on a conservative preliminary design.

.. _h.w5onoae3yw4k:

`Task 2.3 <#p2tas_process%20final>`__\  Hydraulic & Process Design

environment that facilitates full parametric design and the ability to
share documents and collaborate in real time. Onshape is free for
open-source projects and ACR encourages IP to consider developing
expertise in using Onshape. The Onshape 3-D model can be exported and
opened by other CAD programs.

TheOnshape 3-D modelwill include a bill of materials and length
dimensions for materials that need to be cut to length (pipes and
polycarbonate sheets). The bill of materials will include a potential
supplier with their part numbers and costs. The length dimensions list
will provide the dimensions of materials that need to be cut to length
as part of the hydraulic component fabrication.  The Onshape model will
include the following processes:

.. _h.lfngxksagz6b:

`Task 2.4 <#p2tas_tool%20list>`__\  Tool List for Fabrication
-------------------------------------------------------------

ACR will provide a detailed tool list required for fabrication of the
hydraulic components including free-standing machinery, hand tools, and
pipe molding equipment. These tools will enable IP to fabricate the vast
majority of the hydraulic components from generic parts.

.. _h.n8317djouz0r:

`Task 2.5 <#p2tas_inventory%20list>`__\  Replacement Parts
----------------------------------------------------------

-  AguaClara: flow through the plant and treatment process overview
-  Introduction to Onshape (and why ACR chose Onshape as the platform
   for our designs)
-  AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine: from a parts database,
   process physics, and geometric constraints to a 3-D model and a bill
   of materials

Additional webinars can be requested if needed at a rate of $500 per
hour.

.. _h.2fm5wg5k9zpf:

Phase 2 Assumptions
-------------------

IP will be responsible for the following tasks.

Staffing

-  IP will facilitate support with any necessary visas in preparation
   for Phase 3.
-  IP will prepare to provide plant operators from the start of
   construction through commissioning to work with the Honduran
   AguaClara technician.

Structural and Architectural Design,Site Constraints, and Access Road

-  IP will provide final thickness (and possibly unit costs) of
   structural elements as required by the hydraulic design. These will
   include slabs, suspended slabs, tank walls for various water depths,
   and weirs. ACR will add these items to our parts database for
   customization of the hydraulic design for IP.
-  IP will inform ACR of any site constraints that would influence plant
   layout.
-  IP will design an access road and a temporary construction site
   building to store construction materials.

-  IP will create the structural and architectural design.
-  IP will create the required construction and fabrication drawings
   from the Onshape model provided by ACR. The Onshape model can either
   be exported for use in other CAD programs or the drawings can be
   created directly in Onshape.

AguaClara plants require a full building enclosure, built to local code
and in consideration of appropriate structural, electrical, mechanical
and other considerations appropriate to the locale. The enclosure serves
\\ to extend the life of the components and to provide a safe work
environment for the plant operators. The enclosure will protect:

-  the hydraulic components from direct sunlight that would degrade the
   plastics;
-  the plant operators from adverse weather and intruders;
-  the granular coagulants from rain;
-  the clarifier with a floc filter from sunlight, wind, and rain that
   would cause thermal/density currents and increase the clarified water
   turbidity; and,

Material Sourcing for Construction and Operation

IP will prepare to source construction materials, chemicals including
the coagulant and calcium hypochlorite required for plant
operations, and required water quality meters (at minimum a portable
turbidity meter).

ACR will provide an AguaClara technician and a construction advisor. The
construction advisor will be an advisor to the IP foreman who is
responsible for the work. The construction advisor will provide guidance
for construction techniques, order of operations, and the details
required so that the civil work matches the requirements of the
hydraulic components.

The AguaClara technician will supervise fabrication of the hydraulic
components.IP must provide all tools and labor for
fabrication.Fabrication of the hydraulic components will require a
minimum of2 months with 4 full time employees working with the AguaClara
technician.

The AguaClara technician will train the plant operators. ACR recommends
that IP provide a minimum of 5 operators for training to be able to
provide 24/7 plant operation. IP may elect to provide more operators to
prepare for staff transitions.

.. _h.3jywhxoya0zq:

`Task 3.2 <#p3tas_material%20acquisition>`__\  Material Acquisition Support
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACR will provide vendor and part numbers for hydraulic components of the
plant and will review alternatives proposed by IP.

There are several specialized components (pipe molds, constant head tank
for the chemical feeds, and doser system) that could either be purchased
directly from specialty parts suppliers or potentially could be
purchased from ACR. ACR will work with IP to determine which approach is
best.

.. _h.u2psa5eo707l:

`Task 3.3 <#p3tas_tech%20suppory>`__\  Remote Technical Support
---------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the construction advisor and AguaClara technician, ACR
will provide remote technical support throughout Phase 3 and for the
first year of operation. IP can invite ACR staff to relevant meetings
and can contact ACR with questions that arise during the construction
phase and the first year of operation.

.. _h.ilexrf8s6soo:

`Task 3.4 <#p3tas_training>`__\  Webinars for Water Professionals
-----------------------------------------------------------------

ACR will provide the followingremote hour-long training sessions (total
of 5 hours) for water professionals

-  Chemical Dosing
-  Flocculation
-  Floc Filters
-  Plate Settlers
-  Stacked Rapid Sand Filters

This training could be exclusively for IP staff or it could be extended
to include water professionals from the Caribbean. ACR also welcomes IP
recommendations for additional training.

.. _h.cadmhiialc0h:

Phase 3 Assumptions
-------------------

Staffing

-  IP will identify individuals that they want to be trained as
   construction foreman and AguaClara technician so that IP has these
   capabilities in-house forfuture projects.
-  IP plant operators will be responsible for plant operation as soon as
   the plant begins operating. This includes during the initial startup
   and commissioning.

Transport to site

-  IP will provide transport to the worksite for ACR staff.

Material acquisition

-  IP will be responsible for acquiring materials for both the civil
   work and for the hydraulic components. IP and ACR can coordinate with
   Water Mission International or another organization for assistance
   with logistics.
-  IP will be responsible for acquiring the tools as detailed
   in\ `Task 2.4 <#p2t_tool%20list>`__\ .
-  IP is responsible for all freight, customs and duty charges.

Fabrication Workshop

-  IP will provide an enclosed space where the tools
   (see\ `Task 2.4 <#p2t_tool%20list>`__\ ) can be setup and the
   hydraulic components can be fabricated. The workshop can either be
   adjoining the plant construction site or it can be at a more
   convenient location for electricity and for the workers. The workshop
   will be used to assemble hydraulic components including flocculator
   baffle modules, settler modules, manifolds, and filter piping. The
   workshop should have dimensions of at least 12 m x 5 m and will
   require electricity and lighting.

Access Road

-  IP shall provide an access road to facilitate construction and
   operations

Electricity

Construction activities require electricity for:

-  power tools
-  lighting
-  charging batteries

Although AguaClara plants can be operated off-grid there are several
critical power requirements for operation:

-  Lighting for nighttime operations
-  Charging station for cell phones
-  Backwash recycle (option that ACR recommends if there are water
   shortages in the dry season).

The electricity needs for operation could be met by connecting the plant
to the electrical grid or by adding solar panels to the roof. IP is
responsible for selecting and installing the best option. 

Emergency operation without power could be facilitated by discontinuing
backwash recycle.IP is responsible for provision of emergency lighting
during power failures.
