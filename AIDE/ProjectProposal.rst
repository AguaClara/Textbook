Phase 1 - Preliminary Engineering
=================================

The Preliminary Engineering Phase will provide definition to that Project’s scope, schedule, and budget, and includes the necessary technical analysis and operational input to initiate the preparation of Construction Documents during the Design Phase (Phase 2).

ACR shall provide the Implementation Partner (IP) with regular schedule and progress updates during the Preliminary Engineering Phase. ACR shall provide information requested by IP to ensure that all requirements are met for approvals and permits necessary.

Task 1.1 Kickoff Meeting
------------------------

The Preliminary Design phase will begin with a Project Kick-Off Meeting held between AguaClara Reach (ACR), Implementation Partner (IP), and key stakeholders. At a minimum, the Project Designer and Technical Director from ACR will attend the meeting. IP will plan and facilitate the Kickoff Meeting.

During this meeting, lines of communication, team member responsibilities, document distribution, scope of work (goals, expectations, measurements of success) and project schedule will be discussed. Meeting minutes will be developed and distributed by IP. This meeting will be conducted virtually.

Task 1.1.a Project Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project consists of the design and construction of a drinking water treatment system to treat a surface water source using AguaClara technology to supplement IP’s existing supply. IP will provide regulatory limits and standards for the treated water. The required flow rate will be verified during Phase 1.

The AguaClara treatment process design will include electricity-free chemical feed of coagulant and chlorine, flocculation, clarification, filtration, and disinfection. If required for water conservation, ACR will provide a design for backwash recycling that will require a small pump.

IP and ACR shall further update and refine the purpose of this project and its relation to system-wide water provisions following the Kickoff Meeting. 



Task 1.2 Conditions Assessment
------------------------------

Water Quality Monitoring and Testing

It would be ideal to have a year’s worth of turbidity and color measurements prior to building a water treatment plant on a new water source. ACR recognizes that extensive sampling is often not and thus the goal is to target sampling to minimize the risk of an unexpected treatment challenge.

IP shall provide water quality analysis results for the raw water source including turbidity, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and dissolved organic carbon for a minimum of 3 samples representing high turbidity events following rainfall, baseflow conditions during the rainy season, and baseflow conditions during the dry season. Any additional raw water parameters that are also being tested for or monitored as part of the existing facilities shall also be provided. ACR will not provide any water quality testing equipment or analysis.

ACR shall provide guidance to IP to conduct jar tests on a minimum of two samples representing low and high turbidity events.

- ACR shall provide IP with a jar test method and recommend coagulants to be tested.
- IP shall obtain water samples and chemical coagulants as required, and shall conduct the jar tests.
- IP shall provide ACR with the test results, and ACR shall analyze the results.


Task 1.2.a. Conditions Assessment Workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACR shall conduct a workshop to review water quality results, and confirm relevant proposed site data and integration. During this task, ACR shall assess if a site visit is needed as part of Phase 2. Meeting minutes will be developed by ACR and distributed within ten (10) business days following the workshop. This workshop will be conducted virtually.


Task 1.2.b. Feasibility Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ACR shall conduct a feasibility assessment based on the Project Definition and Conditions Assessment. ACR shall provide IP with a memo for review and approval in advance of the Preliminary Engineering Report
(PER) sections that will be provided by ACR. An Action Plan detailing next steps will be included in the Feasibility Assessment memo.

Task 1.3  Preliminary Engineering Report (PER) Sections
-------------------------------------------------------

IP will be writing and is responsible for the PER.ACR will provide PER sections on process, hydraulics, sustainability, operational constraints, and environmental health and safety. 

The PER does not include the evaluation of multiple treatment alternatives with benefits and disadvantages.

Phase 2 - Design
================

The Design Phase will provide the Construction Documents required for the Construction, Installation, Training, and Commissioning Phase.

The Design Phase will require close collaboration between IP and ACR to ensure that the design meets the site constraints, is based on the available generic materials, and addresses the water quality issues identified in Task 1.2.

Task 2.1 Personnel Plan
-----------------------

From the years of building AguaClara plants in Central America ACR has identified four roles that are critical for their successful implementation.

- Structural engineer
- Architect
- Construction foreman
- AguaClara technician

IP will be responsible for providing these staff who will learn the details of AguaClara plant implementation during the design, construction, and startup phases. The construction advisor and AguaClara technician have specialized knowledge about the fabrication and operation of AguaClara plants and the most effective way to transfer that knowledge is to bring experienced staff from Agua Para el Pueblo (APP) to work with the IP for the relevant phases of the project so that they can advise the IP counterparts.

ACR and the IP will determine the best mechanism to hire APP staff and bring them to work along side of IP staff. If required the IP will provide a staff member who is fluent in Spanish to translate for the APP staff.

Task 2.2 Key Materials Selection and Sourcing
---------------------------------------------

The corrugated polycarbonate sheets used for flocculator baffles and plate settlers determine the width of individual clarifier bays. The AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine can be quickly updated with different dimensions for these sheets should that become necessary. IP and ACR will work together to select the best source of these sheets.

ACR and IP will review the list of materials required for construction and operation and determine if any materials need to be ordered before Phase 3 begins and based on a conservative preliminary design.


Task 2.3 Hydraulic & Process Design
-----------------------------------

ACR will develop a detailed 3-D model of the hydraulic components in Onshape. ACR will base these drawings off of the required structural wall thicknesses provided by IP, as indicated in the Phase
2. Onshape is a cloud-based CAD environment that facilitates full parametric design and the ability to share documents and collaborate in real time. Onshape is free for open-source projects and ACR encourages IP to consider developing expertise in using Onshape. The Onshape 3-D model can be exported and opened by other CAD programs.

The Onshape 3-D model will include a bill of materials and a cut list for materials that need to be cut to length (pipes and polycarbonate sheets). The bill of materials will include a potential supplier with their part numbers and costs. The cut list will provide the dimensions of materials that need to be cut to length as part of the hydraulic component fabrication.  The Onshape model will include the following processes:

- Liquid chemical feed system for coagulant and chlorine

- Chemical stock tanks

   - Flow measurement columns
   - Constant level tanks
   - AguaClara doser

- Entrance tank

   - Trash rack
   - Grit removal hoppers
   - Linear flow orifice meter for plant flow rate measurement

- Hydraulic flocculator

   - Baffle modules for uniform velocity gradients
   - Valveless drain system

- Clarifier

   - Inlet channel with valveless isolation of individual tanks
   - Inlet manifold and diffusers
   - Floc weir to control depth of floc filter
   - Plate settlers modules
   - Outlet manifold
   - Outlet channel with level control weir

- Stacked rapid sand (StaRS) filter

   - Self backwashing hydraulic control system
   - 6-layer filter system

Task 2.4 Tool List for Fabrication
----------------------------------

ACR will provide a detailed tool list required for fabrication of the hydraulic components including free-standing machinery, hand tools, and pipe molding equipment. These tools will enable IP to fabricate the vast majority of the hydraulic components from generic parts.

Task 2.5  Replacement Parts
---------------------------

ACR will provide a list of replacement parts that should be maintained for component repairs and replacements.


Task 2.6 Hydraulic Component Fabrication Documentation
------------------------------------------------------

ACR will provide a digital fabrication manual with step-by-step instructions for the following hydraulic components.

- Entrance Tank

  - Trash racks
  - Linear flow orifice meter

- Flocculator

  - Baffle modules

- Clarifier

  - Inlet manifold
  - Plate settler support frame
  - Plate settler modules
  - Outlet manifold

- StaRS filter

  - Inlet and outlet modules
  - Siphon manifold

Task 2.7 Hydraulic and Process Design Calculations
--------------------------------------------------

A report detailing the hydraulic and process design calculations will connect the design equations to this specific design and provide the basis of design and relevant calculations for all of the included unit processes.

Task 2.8 Webinars
-----------------

ACR will provide the following remote hour-long webinars for IP staff

- AguaClara: flow through the plant and treatment process overview
- Introduction to Onshape (and why ACR chose Onshape as the platform
   for our designs)
- AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine: from a parts database,
   process physics, and geometric constraints to a 3-D model and a bill
   of materials

Additional webinars can be requested if needed.

Phase 2 Assumptions
-------------------

IP will be responsible for the following tasks.

Staffing

- IP will facilitate support with any necessary visas in preparation for Phase 3.
- IP will prepare to provide plant operators from the start of construction through commissioning to work with the APP AguaClara technician.

Structural and Architectural Design, Site Constraints, and Access Road

- IP will provide final thickness (and possibly unit costs) of structural elements as required by the hydraulic design. These will include slabs, suspended slabs, tank walls for various water depths, and weirs. ACR will add these items to our parts database for customization of the hydraulic design for IP.
- IP will inform ACR of any site constraints that would influence plant layout.
- IP will design an access road and a temporary construction site building to store construction materials.

- IP will create the structural and architectural design.
- IP will create the required construction and fabrication drawings from the Onshape model provided by ACR. The Onshape model can either be exported for use in other CAD programs or the drawings can be created directly in Onshape.

AguaClara plants require a full building enclosure, built to local code and in consideration of appropriate structural, electrical, mechanical and other considerations appropriate to the locale. The enclosure serves to extend the life of the components and to provide a safe work environment for the plant operators. The enclosure will protect:

- the hydraulic components from direct sunlight that would degrade the plastics;
- the plant operators from adverse weather and intruders;
- the granular coagulants from rain;
- the clarifier with a floc filter from sunlight, wind, and rain that would cause thermal/density currents and increase the clarified water turbidity.

Material Sourcing for Construction and Operation

IP will prepare to source construction materials, chemicals including the coagulant and calcium hypochlorite required for plant operations, and required water quality meters (at minimum a portable turbidity meter).

Phase 3 - Construction, Installation, Training, Commissioning
=============================================================

Task 3.1 Project Site Staffing
------------------------------

There are several areas of specialized knowledge for Phase 3, as detailed in\ `Table 3 <#tab_expertise>`__\ , that can most effectively be transferred to IP by experienced staff who have built plants in Central America.

.. _table_Expertise:

.. csv-table:: Expertise required for civil work and hydraulic components
   :header: Role, months, Area of expertise
   :align: left


   Construction advisor, 3, "Construction methods for the civil work (weirs, hoppers, jet reverser, etc)"
   AguaClara technician, 6, "Fabrication of hydraulic components (plate settler modules, diffusers, filter modules, etc.)
      - includes helping to set up the workshop
      - Operator training
      - Installation of hydraulic components in the plant
      - Plant startup"

IP will contract with APP to provide an AguaClara technician and a construction advisor. The construction advisor will be an advisor to the IP foreman who is responsible for the work. The construction advisor will provide guidance for construction techniques, order of operations, and the details required so that the civil work matches the requirements of the hydraulic components.

The AguaClara technician will supervise fabrication of the hydraulic components. IP must provide all tools and labor for fabrication. Fabrication of the hydraulic components will require a minimum of 2 months with 4 full time employees working with the AguaClara technician.

The AguaClara technician will train the plant operators. ACR recommends that IP provide a minimum of 5 operators for training to be able to provide 24/7 plant operation. IP may elect to provide more operators to prepare for staff transitions.

Task 3.2  Material Acquisition Support
--------------------------------------

ACR will provide vendor and part numbers for hydraulic components of the plant and will review alternatives proposed by IP.

There are several specialized components (pipe molds, constant head tank for the chemical feeds, and doser system) that could either be purchased directly from specialty parts suppliers or potentially could be purchased from ACR. ACR will work with IP to determine which approach is best.

Task 3.3 Remote Technical Support
---------------------------------

In addition to the construction advisor and AguaClara technician, ACR will provide remote technical support throughout Phase 3 and for the first year of operation. IP can invite ACR staff to relevant meetings and can contact ACR with questions that arise during the construction phase and the first year of operation.

Task 3.4 Webinars for Water Professionals
-----------------------------------------

ACR will provide the following remote hour-long training sessions (total of 5 hours) for water professionals

- Chemical Dosing
- Flocculation
- Floc Filters
- Plate Settlers
- Stacked Rapid Sand Filters

This training could be exclusively for IP staff or it could be extended to include water professionals from the region. ACR also welcomes IP recommendations for additional training.

Phase 3 Assumptions
-------------------

Staffing

- IP will identify individuals that they want to be trained as construction foreman and AguaClara technician so that IP has these capabilities in-house for future projects.
- IP plant operators will be responsible for plant operation as soon as the plant begins operating. This includes during the initial startup and commissioning.

Transport to site

- IP will provide transport to the worksite for ACR staff.

Material acquisition

- IP will be responsible for acquiring materials for both the civil work and for the hydraulic components.
- IP will be responsible for acquiring the tools as detailed in Task 2.4.
- IP is responsible for all freight, customs and duty charges.

Fabrication Workshop

- IP will provide an enclosed space where the tools (see Task 2.4) can be setup and the hydraulic components can be fabricated. The workshop can either be adjoining the plant construction site or it can be at a more convenient location for electricity and for the workers. The workshop will be used to assemble hydraulic components including flocculator baffle modules, settler modules, manifolds, and filter piping. The workshop should have dimensions of at least 12 m x 5 m and will require electricity and lighting.

Access Road

- IP shall provide an access road to facilitate construction and operations

Electricity

Construction activities require electricity for:

- power tools
- lighting
- charging batteries

Although AguaClara plants can be operated off-grid there are several critical power requirements for operation:

- Lighting for nighttime operations
- Charging station for cell phones
- Backwash recycle (option that ACR recommends if there are water shortages in the dry season).

The electricity needs for operation could be met by connecting the plant to the electrical grid or by adding solar panels to the roof. IP is responsible for selecting and installing the best option. 

Emergency operation without power could be facilitated by discontinuing backwash recycle. IP is responsible for provision of emergency lighting during power failures.
