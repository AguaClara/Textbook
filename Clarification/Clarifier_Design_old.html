<p>In this section, we will develop a conceptual understanding of the clarifier using figures and images. We will be using a mixture of terminology typically found in water treatment settings and AguaClara-specific terminology. We will discuss the different parts of the clarifier in the sequence that a parcel of water would encounter it, from the beginning of the unit process to the end. The three main sections are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>How water enters the clarifier.</p></li>
<li><p>How water moves through the clarifier.</p></li>
<li><p>How water leaves the clarifier.</p></li>
</ol>

<li><p>Anything that makes parallel flow paths different is “bad” head loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that increases head loss through all of the paths, to make differences between the paths less significant, is “good” head loss.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can artificially introduce the second form of head loss to dominate the resistance and render small variations due to pressure recovery insignificant. We will go through each part of the clarifier to understand how these goals drive AguaClara designs. As we learn about each component, we will attempt to categorize its contribution into creating “good” or “bad” head loss.</p>

<h3>Jet Reverser<a class="headerlink" href="#jet-reverser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The jet reverser is an AguaClara invention for producing stable floc filters. The jet reverser includes a plane jet that is thin and has a high velocity. The momentum of that jet is important because it must counteract the momentum of the density current of the settled flocs. The thin, high velocity jet has a high energy dissipation rate (see Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Fluid_Deformation_and_Energy_Dissipation/FDED_Derivations.html#equation-planejet-edr">(211)</a>) and a high energy dissipation rate undoubtedly breaks up flocs. If the jet breaks flocs into fragments that have a terminal velocity that is less than the capture velocity of the plate settlers, then the clarifier performance will deteriorate.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that breaking up flocs on the way to the clarifier is counter productive. The traditional goal of not breaking flocs led to design of tapered flocculators and guidelines suggesting maximum velocities for transport of those flocs to the clarifier. Dimensional analysis provides the insight that if the constraint for not breaking flocs is actually a velocity, that there must be some way to make that velocity dimensionless if that constraint is rational. In order to identify and characterize the constraint related to floc break up we need to understand the physics of the processes and clearly identify the failure mode.</p>
<p>The maximum shear stress that should be used for design of jet reversers requires further analysis. Flocs composed of less clay and more organic matter or more coagulant nanoparticles will have a lower density and would still be sheared to the same diameter by the fluid shear stress. These flocs would have a lower terminal velocity than clay based flocs and thus they would not be captured by the plate settlers. Thus the design constraint for the fluid shear stress should be based on the lowest density floc that is to be captured by the plate settlers.</p>
<p>Different coagulants may well have different bond strengths and flocculant aids that increase the bond strength all merit study with the jet reverser experiment to determine an appropriate fluid shear stress. The shear stress of 0.55 Pa is likely an upper limit for operation without using flocculant aids.</p>
<p>The maximum fluid shear stress for conservative basis of design should be calculated based on minimum water temperature, plate settler capture velocity, and minimum floc density. The solution path is</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Calculate the diameter of the lowest density floc that has a terminal velocity equal to the capture velocity of the plate settlers.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Flocs_Fractals_and_Forces/FFF_Intro.html#equation-d-floc-shear-stress">(260)</a> for the shear stress given the floc diameter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The jet reverser can be designed given a maximum fluid shear stress that is calculated based on minimum operating temperature, plate settler capture velocity, and floc density. We do not yet have a comprehensive model for floc properties and thus we are not yet able to calculate floc terminal velocity as a function of composition. We do anticipate that floc density decreases dramatically for flocs that consist primarily of dissolved organics and coagulant.</p>
<p>The goal is to derive an equation that will calculate the maximum jet velocity given the upflow velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_{z_{ff}}\)</span>, and width, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{Clarifier}\)</span>, of the clarifier. Begin by eliminating the energy dissipation rate from the fluid shear stress, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Flocs_Fractals_and_Forces/FFF_Intro.html#equation-fluid-shear-stress">(258)</a>, by substituting the plane jet energy dissipation rate, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Fluid_Deformation_and_Energy_Dissipation/FDED_Derivations.html#equation-planejet-edr">(211)</a>.</p>

<p>Given that the velocity gradient governs the design of the flocculator and the entrance to the floc filter we can substitute Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Fluid_Deformation_and_Energy_Dissipation/FDED_Derivations.html#equation-tau-of-mu-g">(92)</a> to obtain</p>

<p>The geometry of the clarifier changes in these four zones, so we will follow these changes to make sure that we understand the conservation of flow. The flow going through the clarifier is the same everywhere, but average velocities are different. The fact that flow rate is velocity multiplied by area, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q = \bar v A\)</span>, will be our guiding principle. In all cases,</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Clarifier} =\)</span> flow rate through each clarifier</div>

<p>After the water exits the diffusers and jet reverser, it flows through the expanded floc filter region where:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{SedFloc} =\)</span> length of the clarifier that has a floc filter</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_{z_{ff}} =\)</span> upflow velocity of the water through the floc filter</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Clarifier} = W_{Clarifier}*L_{SedFloc}* \bar v_{z_{ff}}\)</span></p>
<p>The line jet from the diffusers enters the jet reverser to force flow up through the clarifier bay. The vertical upward jet momentum is used to resuspend flocs that have settled to the bottom of the clarifier. The resuspended flocs form a fluidized bed which is called a <strong>floc filter</strong>. The bed is fluidized because flocs are kept in suspension by the upflowing water.</p>
<p>For a floc filter to form 1) all flocs must be returned to the bottom of the clarifier and 2) all settled flocs must be resuspended by incoming water. As will be discussed soon, plate settlers are used to return flocs to the bottom of the bay, while the jet reverser and sloped bottom geometry allow for floc resuspension. Any surface with a horizontal component in a clarifier must be sloped to allow settled flocs to return to the resuspension zone. A flat bottom geometry does not allow for the formation of a floc filter, as discussed previously.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By providing additional collision potential. The high concentration of particles, with a suspended solids concentrations of approximately 1-5 g/L, leads to an increase in collisions and particle aggregation. As discussed for vertical flow clarifiers, flocculation can occur in a floc filter due to shear from suspended flocs which are colliding and growing. Fluidized flocs provide a collision potential of a few thousand. This collision potential is small compared to the collision potential from the flocculator. So how does a small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{CS} \theta\)</span> cause a large reduction in turbidity? The two-fold answer may be that the lower <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{CS}\)</span> value provides an opportunity for all flocs to grow larger without floc breakup. The high concentration of flocs provides many opportunities for clay particles to collide with big flocs, but it is not clear if or when those collisions are successful. We also want to know which flocs are active or inactive in collisions in the floc filter. See the section on <span class="xref std std-ref">floc filter design</span> for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>By creating a uniform vertical velocity of water entering the plate settlers.</p></li>
<li><p>By transporting excess floc consolidation pipe with a drain port, called the floc hopper. The floc hopper is discussed in the next section.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While we have just explained three reasons that the floc filter improves clarifier effluent quality, we do not yet have a model for floc filter performance. Additional research is needed to create this model, and to determine optimal upflow velocity.</p>
<p>Consider the requirements that we have stated for the creation of the floc filter. Could we design for a floc filter in a treatment plant that experiences flow variability? There are some plants that only run for certain hours of the day. While this intermittent flow would impact many parts of the plant, how would it impact the floc filter specifically? Can a settled floc filter be resuspended?</p>
<p>We do not yet have a way to design for variable or intermittent flow rates in a clarifier. The ability of a settled floc filter to resuspend is dependent on the characteristics of the flocs themselves. For example, sticky and clumpy flocs would have a more difficult time resuspending because they tend to settle into hard masses in the absence of sufficient upflow velocities. The capacity for resuspension may require site-specific analysis. The AguaClara pilot PF300 in testing at the Cornell Water Treatment Plant is going to determine whether the floc filter at that site will be able to intermittent flow; the pilot plant and the Cornell Water Treatment Plant will be offline from around 10pm - 5am daily.</p>
<p>It is of interesting note that the suspended solids concentration in the floc filter is approximately 1-5 g/L. This concentration corresponds to measurements of thousands of NTU, which is remarkably turbid water. A water treatment plant could have 5 NTU water entering the plant, and water in the bottom of the clarifier could have 1000 NTU. This is one clue that there are interesting things happening in the floc filter; the bottom of the clarifier can be a completely different world from the rest of the treatment process.</p>
<p>An understanding of the bottom of a clarifier is important to understand how clarifiers work. However, most clarifiers do not allow the operator to observe what is happening. Without being able to observe the bottom of the clarifier, an operator would not know what is happening or if a floc filter is forming successfully. AguaClara research teams are working to develop a probe to get data on floc filter performance. Until then, there are two ways to learn about the floc filter. The AguaClara plant at the University of Zamorano in Honduras was built with a translucent wall on one end of a clarifier bay. This allows students and operators to observe the floc filter. The AguaClara pilot PF300 in testing at the Cornell Water Treatment Plant has small sample ports installed into the side of the reactor. Drawing a sample of water at different heights of the reactor will indicate if a floc filter has grown, and how deep it is.</p>
<p>Let’s recap some important conclusions from this section on the floc filter.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The low G flocculation in the floc filter may allow for the rapid growth of the flocs coming from the flocculator.</p></li>
<li><p>The floc filter reduces the effluent turbidity from the clarifier.</p></li>
<li><p>The floc filter requires a mechanism to keep the flocs resuspended:
- An upflow velocity of approximately 1 mm/s is the current AguaClara design parameter;
- Sloped surfaces to return flocs to the resuspension point is necessary to prevent floc build-up.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not have a model for floc filter performance, meaning that we don’t know the optimal floc filter depth or optimal upflow velocity.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not yet have a consistent way for operators to observe the floc filter.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not know what exactly contributes to the ability of a floc filter to resuspend or survive variable flow.</p></li>

<p>However, remember the diffusers that distribute water into the clarifier? They create velocities on the order of 100 mm/s. Those high initial velocities are damped out by the floc filter which helps to distribute the flow. If we weren’t able to use the floc filter to dampen the flow to be less than 4 mm/s, then the plate settlers would not provide any head loss to help with uniform flow distribution. This point about uniform flow is really important.</p>
<p id="heading-floc-volcano-intro">Let’s recap some important conclusions from this section on plate settlers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Reynolds number calculations of flow through plate settlers prove that there is laminar flow between plate settlers. This is important because it allows us to assume that a parabolic velocity profile is established.</p></li>
<li><p>There is very low head loss between plate settlers so they will not do a good job of helping to achieve uniform flow between the plate settlers.</p></li>
<li><p>The plate settlers are designed to capture flocs with terminal velocities greater than the settle capture velocity. AguaClara currently uses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c = 0.12\)</span> mm/s but this value needs to be further optimized; we would like to know how settled water turbidity changes with capture velocity. Future work includes choosing a settle capture velocity based on overall plate performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Plate settler spacing:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Plate settler spacing determines the ability of flocs to roll down the incline.</p></li>
<li><p>Smaller spacings between plate setters have diminishing returns in terms of clarifier depth. The current AguaClara spacing is 2.5 cm but there is room for further optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Flocs made from natural organic matter (NOM) may be less dense, more prone to floc rollup, and may require larger spacing between plate settlers.</p></li>

<p>You can review your understanding of AguaClara clarifiers by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Why do horizontal flow clarifiers perform must worse than theory predicts?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the floc filter improve clarifier performance?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the purpose of the floc hopper?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do we use plate settlers?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the failure mechanism for small spacing between plate settlers?</p></li>
<li><p>What helps the flow divide evenly between and within the clarifiers?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The hydraulic self cleaning clarifier with a high performing floc filter, zero sludge accumulation, and with no moving parts outperforms conventional clarifiers on capital cost, performance, and maintenance costs. We will now transition to the mathematical models which explain how we make these advancements possible.</p>
