The objective is to develop a simple model, based on physical phenomena, and that does not contain any adjustable parameters. Floc size distributions obtained using a part of a particle image velocimetry (PIV) device and image analysis are used to develop mathematical expressions for the aggregation and breakage kernels. A critical volume beyond which breakage is of significant importance is identified and related to the hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic sequencing allows the distribution of the daughter particles resulting from a breakage event to be established. The model is finally successfully validated against experimental results.},

	abstract = {A mechanistically-based model is developed to characterize flocculation in the context of flow regimes with high Peclet numbers such as would occur in serpentine flow reactors. These flow conditions are obtained in gravity-driven hydraulic flocculators without mechanical agitation that are an important component of sustainable water treatment systems where energy efficiency and cost are receiving increasing emphasis. The model incorporates a fractal description of flocs, estimates of floc separation distances, estimates of relative velocities of floc particles dependent on the relevant flow regime, and provides an overall prediction of the required reaction time for formation of settleable flocs based on influent turbidity, alum dose, and energy dissipation rate. Viscosity is shown to be significant for the early stage of flocculation and turbulent eddies are shown to be significant for the final stage of flocculation. The collision potential defined as the product of the hydraulic residence time (θ) and the cube root of the energy dissipation rate (ɛ), i.e., ɛ 1 / 3 θ , is shown to be a better predictor of flocculator performance than the conventional product of θ and the velocity gradient (G), i.e., Gθ.},

Mean power input per unit mass to the two thirds power is a more appropriate flocculation parameter than G for common water and wastewater flocculation practice because the important turbulent eddies are larger than the Kolmogoroff microscale.

Once built, it is argued, they do not provide the operational flexibility to compensate for flow fluctuations or changing raw water characteristics. The design procedure developed in this paper demonstrates the contrary, namely that hydraulic flocculators can be designed to satisfactorily cope with tapered velocity gradients, flow variations and water quality variations. The procedure is based on a two-step approach; the horizontal layout is first determined with average values for velocity gradient and water depth; then only the floor slope and exact water depths are determined to enable satisfactory flocculation for all design scenarios.},

	abstract = {Hydraulic flocculators are principally characterized by their volume (which determines the time of
flocculation) and the water level difference between inlet and outlet (which determines the average
energy dissipation).Within these constraints, however, the designer has many degrees of freedom,
such as the average water depth, the number and spacing of baffles, the length of the gap at the
baffle ends, and the degree to which adjoining baffles overlap. In an earlier paper (Haarhoff 1998),
these variables were systematically reduced to a number of critical ratios, and a comprehensive
mathematical framework was presented whereby hydraulic flocculators can be designed once these
ratios are fixed. In this paper, these ratios are further investigated by computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) to find their optimal values. The validity of CFD modelling is first verified by comparing
experimentally measured velocities in two flocculators against modelled velocities for similar
hydraulic conditions. CFD is then used to systematically optimize the three critical design ratios for
flocculator design. The optimal ratios are considered to be those that cause the least deviation from
the average G-value; addressing the concern that there may be large G-value differences at different
points in the flocculator.},

	abstract = {Coagulation mechanisms of polyaluminum chloride (PACl) at various dosages were studied using a conventional jar test at different final and initial pH values during treating kaolin suspension. The optimal final pH and dosages for PACl were obtained based on residual turbidity and zeta potential of flocs. The coagulation zones at various PACl dosages and solution pH values were developed and compared with those of alum. It is found that the optimal mechanism under acidic condition is charge neutralization, while alkaline condition will facilitate the coagulation of PACl. Both charge neutralization coagulation and sweep coagulation can achieve high coagulation efficiency under the alkaline condition ranging from final pH 7.0 to 10.0. Stabilization, charge neutralization destabilization, restabilization and sweep zones occur successively with increasing PACl dosages with the final pH values fixed at 7.0 and 8.0, but restabilization zone disappears at final pH 10.0. When the final pH is not controlled and consequently decreases with increasing PACl dosage, no typical sweep zone can be observed and the coagulant efficiency decreases at high PACl dosage. It seems that the final pH is more meaningful than the initial pH for coagulation. Charge neutralization coagulation efficiency is dominated by zeta potential of flocs and PACl precipitates. The charge neutralization and sweep coagulation zones of PACl are broader in the ranges of coagulant dosage and pH than those of alum. The results are helpful for us to treat water and wastewater using PACl and to understand the coagulation process of PACl.},

Batch flocculation experiments were performed for monodisperse, bimodal, and trimodal latex suspensions. The effects of mixing intensity, particle charge, and suspension concentration on the rate of change in particle size distributions were studied. Experimental results indicated that large eddies are relatively unimportant for flocculation and that flocculation is induced by eddies of approximately the same size as the particles. A method for estimating the velocity gradients in eddies of different sizes in the flow was developed and incorporated into an existing mathematical model for flocculation. The predictions of the revised flocculation model were compared with the experimental results and indicated that the velocity gradients of the eddies adequately describe the interparticle contacts resulting from mixing during flocculation.

Se estudiaron los efectos que tienen la intensidad del mezclado, la carga de las partículas, y la concentración de suspensión sobre el índice de cambios en la distribución según el tamaño de las partículas. Los resultados de los experimentos demostraron que remolinos grandes tienen poca importancia en la floculación, y que la floculación es inducida por remolinos de aproximadamente el mismo tamaño de las partículas.

Results for the point-to-point calculation are compared with experimental measurements of flocculation efficiency in a full-scale model of a channel hydraulic flocculator, and an extremely good fit is obtained, demonstrating the point-to-point approach to be an accurate method of determining flocculation efficiency in channel hydraulic flocculators. A design example is presented showing how the point-to-point approach can be used in practice.

Quantification of particle size distributions under different operating conditions can be of use in the understanding of aggregation mechanisms.

Identification of out-of-focus flocs was automated with LabVIEW and used to remove them from the database that was analyzed. The particle diameter of the test suspension of kaolinite clay was measured to be 7.7 ± 3.8 μm and a linear relationship was obtained between turbidity and the concentration of clay particles determined by imaging. The analysis technique was applied to characterize flocs and floc particle size distribution as a function of coagulant dose. Removal of flocs by sedimentation was characterized by imaging, and the negative logarithm of the fraction of turbidity remaining after settling had a linear relationship with the logarithm of aluminum dose. The maximum floc size observed in the settled water was less than 120 μm, which was in accordance with the value predicted by a model for the capture velocity of the experimental tube settler of 0.21 mm/s.},

Polydisperse systems are also considered and some general results concerning their behavior are obtained. Coagulation experiments are reported on inside fully developed turbulent pipe flows using an approximately monodisperse UCAR latex dispersion in which the particle sizes are less than the Kolmogorov microscale. The flow rate, destabilizer concentration and volume fraction of the dispersed phase were varied in these experiments. The experimental results for destabilized particles are shown to agree very well with the theoretical predictions.

	abstract = {The complex nature of particulate matter in natural water resources and in waste waters is characterized by the heterogeneous distribution of particle size, shape, density, and shear strength. Among these parameters, floc strength is most important in the last stages of flocculation. Experimental data on floc strength based on different methods are assessed and correlated with shear gradients in different aquatic environments. The analysis of turbulent motion reveals that the energy which affects particle agglomerates is only a small portion of the totally dissipated energy. Among the different flow fields in turbulent motion, converging/diverging flow cause strain forces which prove to be critical with respect to floc rupture. Model calculations of the surface forces on ellipsoidal particles in pure shear and strain flow fields and corresponding experiments confirm the importance of converging flow. A comparison of modeled and measured rupture forces allows to establish relationships between floc size, strain and shear rates and resulting surface forces leading to probable floc break-up. Flocs of appreciable size (200 - 2000 μm) prepared for settling are likely to be ruptured under moderate velocity gradients occurring in flocculation tanks, whereas smaller agglomerates ({\textless} 200 μm) may withstand strain forces much higher than found under practical conditions. An example of model application shows the particle stress in the entrance to porous media filters where typically high strain gradients may easily lead to a breakup of flocs larger than 200 μm.},

	abstract = {A predictive, mechanistically based performance model for hydraulic flocculation could potentially enable improved design for hydraulic flocculators. Such a model would take characteristics of the flocculator and the suspension as inputs so that designers and operators could rationally consider effects of changing flocculator dimensions or influent water conditions on performance. A performance model exists for laminar flocculators, but a model applicable to turbulent flocculators is still needed, as real scale flocculators operate in the turbulent regime. This article outlines a theoretical approach that suggests the form of two dimensionless composite parameters that account for the influence of raw water turbidity, coagulant dose, flocculator hydraulic residence time, and energy dissipation rate on settled water turbidity. The utility of these parameters in describing turbulent flocculation will require testing and validation. Thus, this article also describes the design of a suitable laboratory test apparatus that produces turbulent flow conditions that mimic those in a baffled hydraulic flocculator.

Explains the fundamental theory and mathematics of water and wastewater treatment processes

By carefully explaining both the underlying theory and the underlying mathematics, this text enables readers to fully grasp the fundamentals of physical and chemical treatment processes for water and wastewater. Throughout the book, the authors use detailed examples to illustrate real-world challenges and their solutions, including step-by-step mathematical calculations. Each chapter ends with a set of problems that enable readers to put their knowledge into practice by developing and analyzing complex processes for the removal of soluble and particulate materials in order to ensure the safety of our water supplies.

Designed to give readers a deep understanding of how water treatment processes actually work, Water Quality Engineering explores:

    Application of mass balances in continuous flow systems, enabling readers to understand and predict changes in water quality
    Processes for removing soluble contaminants from water, including treatment of municipal and industrial wastes
    Processes for removing particulate materials from water
    Membrane processes to remove both soluble and particulate materials

Following the discussion of mass balances in continuous flow systems in the first part of the book, the authors explain and analyze water treatment processes in subsequent chapters by setting forth the relevant mass balance for the process, reactor geometry, and flow pattern under consideration.

With its many examples and problem sets, Water Quality Engineering is recommended as a textbook for graduate courses in physical and chemical treatment processes for water and wastewater. By drawing together the most recent research findings and industry practices, this text is also recommended for professional environmental engineers in search of a contemporary perspective on water and wastewater treatment processes.},

	abstract = {In water treatment, flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration. Fluidized beds of flocs (floc filters) are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve clarifier particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used. Overall performance of a clarifier containing a floc filter is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs from the flocculator. Floc filters provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators, while improving particle removal efficiency. In this study, laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient (G) and residence time (θ) were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment system with a floc filter. Results indicate that increasing G (range of 74–251 s−1), while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s, and maintaining a constant Gθ (∼20,000) improved particle removal. These results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times (and associated construction costs) when upflow sedimentation with a floc filter and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation. Further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a G of 251 s−1 resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). When varying θ at a constant G of 72 s−1, an apparent minimum in settled effluent turbidity at 0.15 NTU was observed at the middle residence time tested (θ = 211 s), suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal.},

	abstract = {Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) is a well-established coagulant in water treatment with high removal efficiency for arsenic. A high content of Al30 nanoclusters in PACl improves the removal efficiency over broader dosage and pH range. In this study we tested PACl with 75\% Al30 nanoclusters (PAClAl30) for the treatment of arsenic-contaminated well water by laboratory batch experiments and field application in the geothermal area of Chalkidiki, Greece, and in the Pannonian Basin, Romania. The treatment efficiency was studied as a function of dosage and the nanoclusters’ protonation degree. Acid–base titration revealed increasing deprotonation of PAClAl30 from pH 4.7 to the point of zero charge at pH 6.7. The most efficient removal of As(III) and As(V) coincided with optimal aggregation of the Al nanoclusters at pH 7–8, a common pH range for groundwater. The application of PAClAl30 with an Altot concentration of 1–5 mM in laboratory batch experiments successfully lowered dissolved As(V) concentrations from 20 to 230 μg/L to less than 5 μg/L. Field tests confirmed laboratory results, and showed that the WHO threshold value of 10 μg/L was only slightly exceeded (10.8 μg/L) at initial concentrations as high as 2300 μg/L As(V). However, As(III) removal was less efficient (\&lt;40\%), therefore oxidation will be crucial before coagulation with PAClAl30. The presence of silica in the well water improved As(III) removal by typically 10\%. This study revealed that the Al30 nanoclusters are most efficient for the removal of As(V) from water resources at near-neutral pH.},

For the jammed state we have evaluated the pair correlation function for the disks and the size distribution for non-overlapping holes. The coverage saturates asymptotically as τ−12, where τ is the number of attempts to place a new disk. From electron microscopic examination of uranyl acetate stained ferritin, we conclude that this iron storage protein adsorbs on carbon in a way consistent with our results for random sequential adsorption.},

	abstract = {1. Die Gesetze der Koagulationskinetik lassen sich nicht aus dem Studium einer einzigen, indirekt durch Koagulation beeinflussten Größe (Zähigkeit u. dergl.) ableiten, da es ein eindeutiges Koagulationsmass nicht gibt. Relativ einfache Gesetze sind nur für die zeitliche Veränderlichkeit der Anzahlen der Teilchen (oder Aggregate verschiedener Kategorien) zu erwarten. II. Als Grundlage einer mathematischen Koagulationstheorie wird angenommen, dass nach Versetzung einer kolloiden Lösung mit einem Elektrolyten gewisse, die Teilchen umgebende Anziehungsbereiche in Wirkung treten, dass aber die Brownsche Bewegung eines jeden Teilchens unverändert vor sich geht, solange dasselbe sich nicht im Anziehungsbereich eines anderen befindet. Die Art und Grösse jener Anziehungsbereiehe hängt in einer erst näher festzustellenden Weise mit der Elektrolytkonzentration und der dadurch bewirkten Änderung der elektrischen Doppelschicht zusammen. III. Für den Grenzfall "rascher" Koagulation, infolge relativ grossen Elektrolytzusatzes, kann· man annehmen, dass ein jedes Teilchen, sobald sein Mittelpunkt in den Anziehungsbereich eines anderen tritt, für immer mit demselben vereinigt bleibt. Unter Voraussetzung kugelförmiger Anziehungsbereiche und gewisser die Rechnung vereinfachender Annahmen lassen sich damit für die Anzahlen der Teilchenkomplexe bestimmter Art, welche sich aus einem ursprünglich gleichförmigen Kolloid in der Zeit t gebildet haben, Formeln (23) und (24) ableiten, welche das einfachste Schema eines idealen Koagulationsverlaufes darstellen. Dieselben entsprechen in bezug auf die Abhitngigkeit vom Kolloidgehalt der bimolekularen Reaktionskinetik. IV. Diese Formeln stehen mit vorläufigen, von Zsigmondy an koagulierenden Goldlösungen ausgeführten Teilchenzählnngen in genügender Übereinstimmung; es folgt aus ihnen, dass die Grössenordnung der Änziehungssphäre in jenen Fällen ungefähr dem Teilchendurchmesser entspricht, d. h. dass die Teilchen sich beinahe berühren müssen, damit merkliche Anziehung eintrete. V. Durch Einführung der Annahme, dass von den Zusammenstössen der Teilchen nur ein gewisser konstanter Bruchteil eta zur Vereinigung führt, lässt sich obige Koagulationstheorie erweitern, so dass sie auch als einfachstes Schema der langsamen, bei geringem Elektrolytzusatz stattfindenden Koagulation dienen kann. VI. Von diesem Standpunkt aus lassen sich sowohl die Messungen H. Paines, wie auch jene, welche J. Gann bei Verwendung einwertiger anorganischer Koagulatoren angestellt hat, in vollkommen befriedigender Weise interpretieren. Insbesondere erweisen sich die beiden, auf die Abhängigkeit von der Konzentration des Kolloids und des Koagulators bezüglichen Ähnlichkeitsgesetze als gültig. Die bei Verwendung mehrwertiger oder anorganischer Ionen auftretenden Anomalien dürften entweder auf einer Abhängigkeit des eta von der Teilchengrösse oder auf der Veränderung der Konzentration in folge Adsorption des Koagulators beruhen. VII. "Rasche" Koagulation und chemische Reaktionsprozesse bilden entgegengesetzte Extremfälle. Erstere ist ein reines Diffusionsphänomen, bei letzleren bewirkt eine noch unbekannte, mit der Wertigkeit zusammenhängende Ursache, dass nur ein ganz minimaler Teil der Molekularstösse zu chemischer Vereinigung führt.},

	abstract = {Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) is a commonly used coagulant for water treatment. One mode of action of PACl  is reported to be through the formation of polymeric Al-oxyhydroxide precipitate aggregates that bridge between colloids. Although many studies have considered the effectiveness of PACl under a spectrum of conditions for influent suspensions, little is known about the effect of precipitate aggregate size on the subsequent formation of flocs that can be readily removed by sedimentation. Self-aggregation of polymeric Al-oxyhydroxide precipitate and the rate at which this occurs may be used to guide the designs used for the mixing of coagulant with the raw water. In this research, a novel kinetic aggregation model was developed and validated to give the precipitate aggregate size before mixing with a colloidal suspension and entering a flocculator. Granular PACl, a form commonly marketed and used in the developing world, was used for experiments. Efficacy of polymeric Al-oxyhydroxide precipitates of varying aggregate size in flocculation and sedimentation of a kaolin suspension was experimentally observed. These data, in combination with modeling results and geometric analysis, show that under the experimental conditions tested in this research, polymeric Al-oxyhydroxide self-aggregation consistently lowers attachment efficiency of the colloidal suspension, reduces the effectiveness of the flocculator, and reduces turbidity removal. Generally, minimization of aggregate size and maximum turbidity removal is best accomplished by immediate, rapid, and efficient mixing of PACl with the influent water. The relationship between residual turbidity and PACl dose is consistent with results from a geometric adhesive model of coagulation in which surface coverage of colloids by polymeric Al-oxyhydroxide aggregates governs the effectiveness of collisions.},
