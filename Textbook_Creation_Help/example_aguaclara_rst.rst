***********************************************
Functionality in RST and AguaClara Convention
***********************************************
This file will explain how to use rst functionality including images, tables, code, equations, and both internal and cross-document refereces. Additionally, this document is intended to define convention for this textbook. Any syntax included in this document should be used when contributing to the textbook project. If you come across a function for which there is no convention, please include it here.



.. _how_to_use_this_file:

How to use this file:
=====================
Open the source code of the file next to the rendered code. The source code is found by clicking "View page source" at the top of the page. Follow along with the source code and rendered code, using the source code as a reference for the proper syntax.

.. important:: **Proper indentation and line spacing is extremely important**


.. _headers:

Headers
-------
Always have a clear, informative title, as seen above.
For headings, use the following:

* \* with overline, for sections

* = for sections

* -, for subsections

* ^, for subsubsections

* â€œ, for subsubsubsections

Though rst is written in a way that makes any heading ordering implied, this textbook will use the above heading hierarchy for consistency.

.. important:: Before every section and subsection header, include a call reference in the line before the header. For this subsection, the reference is ``.. _headers`` and is used in the `links_and_references`_ section, which you will read soon.


.. _code:

Code
----
When writing code, :code:`use an inline code block with this syntax` or ``this syntax`` or a

    .. code::

      code block

.. _figures:

Figures
-------
Every figure should have a caption, alternative text, and a label. A caption is written below all of the figure specifications, with a line between the two.  The label used to reference a figure is written before the figure directive. Below, the two figures are ``fluffy_cat`` and ``mountain_figure``.

Use the following syntax for including figures from online sources::

  .. _fluffy_cat:
  .. figure:: https://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/A-fluffy-cat-looking-funny-surprised-or-concerned.jpg
      :width: 200px
      :align: center
      :height: 100px
      :alt: external figure

      This is a caption.

Use this syntax for figures located within the /Textbook repository on GitHub::

  .. _mountain_figure:
  .. figure:: mountain.jpg
      :width: 300px
      :align: center
      :alt: internal figure

      Here is a figure labeled ``mountain``. Specify the figure location with folder/image.jpg.
      The base directory for figure location is the directory of the file you are writing.
      In this case, that is Textbook/Textbook_Creation_Help.

Displayed below are the two figures generated using the code above.

    .. _fluffy_cat:
    .. figure:: https://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/A-fluffy-cat-looking-funny-surprised-or-concerned.jpg
        :width: 200px
        :align: center
        :height: 100px
        :alt: external figure

        This is a caption.

    .. _mountain_figure:
    .. figure:: mountain.jpg
        :width: 300px
        :align: center
        :alt: internal figure

        Here is a figure labeled ``mountain``. Specify the figure location with folder/image.jpg.
        The base directory for figure location is the directory of the file you are writing.
        In this case, that is Textbook/Textbook_Creation_Help.


.. _math:

Math
----
Math is very cool, and works natively in rst using LaTeX math syntax. In-line math can be written with the following syntax: ``:math:`y = ax^2 + bx + c``` which displays :math:`y = ax^2 + bx + c`. To display equations in their own line, use the following syntax::

  .. math::
     :label: quadratic

        y = ax^2 + bx + c

Which displays as:

  .. math::
     :label: quadratic

        y = ax^2 + bx + c

Complex equations can be generated as well, since rst uses LaTeX math.

  .. math::

     n_{\rm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \frac{s_k}{n_k} \ln \left( \frac{k}{k!} \right)


.. _equations:

Equations
---------
When introducing a new equation, Make sure to specify what the parameters in the equation mean. Once the equation has been introduced, its parameters do not need to be explained when displayed in the future. Use the following syntax for introducing equations::

    .. math::
      :label: continuity_equation

         \bar v_1 \frac{\pi D_1^2}{4} = \bar v_2 \frac{\pi D_2^2}{4}

  | Such that:
  | :math:`Q =` fluid flow rate
  | :math:`\bar v =` fluid average velocity
  | :math:`A =` pipe area
  | :math:`r =` pipe radius
  | :math:`D =` pipe diameter

The following equation uses the code from the block above except for ``:label: continuity_equation``, as it is an equation too minor to be referenced. Adding labels to equations is up to the discretion of the contributor.

  .. math::

      \bar v_1 \frac{\pi D_1^2}{4} = \bar v_2 \frac{\pi D_2^2}{4}

  | Such that:
  | :math:`Q =` fluid flow rate
  | :math:`\bar v =` fluid average velocity
  | :math:`A =` pipe area
  | :math:`r =` pipe radius
  | :math:`D =` pipe diameter


.. _tables:

Tables
------
Tables should be made using csv for compatibility with excel::

  .. _an_example_table:
  .. csv-table:: a title
     :header: "name", "firstname", "age"
     :widths: 20, 20, 10
     :align: center

     "Smith", "John", 40
     "Smith", "John, Junior", 20

The code block above generates the following table:

.. _an_example_table:
.. csv-table:: This table has a title
   :header: "name", "firstname", "age"
   :widths: 20, 20, 10
   :align: center

   "Smith", "John", 40
   "Smith", "John, Junior", 20


.. _links_and_references:

Links and References for Documents, Figures, and Tables
--------------------------------------------------------
Links are fairly straightforward, use the following syntax, ```hyperlink word display <aguaclarareach.org>`_``, and look like this `hyperlink word display <https://www.aguaclarareach.org/>`_. References work by referencing any "target." There are two types of references, internal and external.

Internal References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Internal references link to figures, tables, or headers that are in the same document as the reference itself. All types of call-able references can be accessed using their labels, and they all follow the same syntax. Equations don't appear to be referencable by this syntax.

* Figures: ```fluffy_cat`_`` gives `fluffy_cat`_
* Tables: ```an_example_table`_`` gives `an_example_table`_
* Headers: ```How to use this file:`_`` gives `How to use this file:`_


External References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are references to documents, equations, figures, tables, or headers in another file in the textbook. Note that clicking these references will take you away from this document, necessarily.

* Documents: ``:ref:`rst_intro``` gives :ref:`rst_intro`
* Equations: ``:eq:`orifice_equation``` only generates a number in parentheses. Thus, this reference should be preceeded by the word: 'equation.' Like this: equation :eq:`orifice_equation`
* Figures: ``:numref:`continuity_pipes``` gives :numref:`continuity_pipes`
* Tables: ``:numref:`dimension_table``` gives :numref:`dimension_table`
* Headers: ``:ref:`what_is_rst``` gives :ref:`what_is_rst`

This can be a figure :numref:`mountain_figure`, equation :eq:`quadratic`, or table :numref:`an_example_table`.


.. _python_and_doctests:

Python and Doctests
--------------------
* Test some python code with doctests. To test the code, run :code:`make doctest` as described `here <http://docs.sphinxdocs.com/en/latest/step-3.html>`_. In the linked document, there are many more options for controlling doctest behavior.

    >>> python="code"
    >>> print(5+14)
    19

* You can even print and test tables in doctests:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> names_male = pd.Series(['Obama', 'Monroe', 'Jack'])
    >>> names_female = pd.Series(['Michelle', 'Juanita', 'Jill'])
    >>> var_names = dict( female_names = names_female, male_names = names_male)
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(var_names)
    >>> print(df)
      female_names male_names
    0     Michelle      Obama
    1      Juanita     Monroe
    2         Jill       Jack

* To get doctests to pass through Travis, you'll have to add any packages you use to the install step in ".travis.yml". Under install, add a line that says :code:`pip install my_package==0.0.0`. When doing this, make sure to specify the version as functionality can change!


.. _assorted_convention:

Assorted Other Convention
-------------------------
* Colored :red:`text`. Add colors/styles by using roles defined in /conf.py and /_static/css/custom.css.
