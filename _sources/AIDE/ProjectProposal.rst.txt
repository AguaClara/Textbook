.. _heading_Personnel_Plan:

Task 2.1 Personnel Plan
-----------------------

From the years of building AguaClara plants in Central America ACR has identified four roles that are critical for their successful implementation.

- Structural engineer
- Architect
- Construction foreman
- AguaClara technician

The IP will be responsible for providing these staff who will learn the details of AguaClara plant implementation during the design, construction, and startup phases. The construction advisor and AguaClara technician have specialized knowledge about the fabrication and operation of AguaClara plants and the most effective way to transfer that knowledge is to bring experienced staff from Agua Para el Pueblo (APP) to work with the IP for the relevant phases of the project so that they can advise the IP counterparts.

ACR and the IP will determine the best mechanism to hire APP staff and bring them to work along side of IP staff. If required the IP will provide a staff member who is fluent in Spanish to translate for the APP staff.

.. _heading_Key_Materials_Selection_and_Sourcing:

Task 2.2 Key Materials Selection and Sourcing
---------------------------------------------

The corrugated polycarbonate sheets used for flocculator baffles and plate settlers determine the width of individual clarifier bays. The AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine can be quickly updated with different dimensions for these sheets should that become necessary. The IP and ACR will work together to select the best source of these sheets.

ACR and IP will review the list of materials required for construction and operation and determine if, based on a conservative preliminary design, any materials need to be ordered before Phase 3 begins.

.. _heading_Hydraulic_and_Process_Design:

Task 2.3 Hydraulic and Process Design
-------------------------------------

ACR will develop a detailed 3-D model of the hydraulic components in Onshape. ACR will base these drawings off of the required structural wall thicknesses provided by IP, as indicated in the :ref:`heading_Phase_2_Assumptions`. Onshape is a cloud-based CAD environment that facilitates full parametric design and the ability to share documents and collaborate in real time. Onshape is free for open-source projects and ACR encourages the IP to consider developing expertise in using Onshape. The Onshape 3-D model can be exported and opened by other CAD programs.

The Onshape 3-D model will include a bill of materials and a cut list for materials that need to be cut to length (pipes and polycarbonate sheets). The bill of materials will include a potential supplier with their part numbers and costs. The cut list will provide the dimensions of materials that need to be cut to length as part of the hydraulic component fabrication.  The Onshape model will include the following processes:

- Liquid chemical feed system for coagulant and chlorine

- Chemical stock tanks

   - Flow measurement columns
   - Constant level tanks
   - AguaClara doser |Doser|

- Entrance tank |EntranceTank|

   - Trash rack

---------------------------

ACR will provide a list of replacement parts that should be maintained for component repairs and replacements.

.. _heading_Hydraulic_Component_Fabrication_Documentation:

Task 2.6 Hydraulic Component Fabrication Documentation
------------------------------------------------------

ACR will provide a digital fabrication manual with step-by-step instructions for the following hydraulic components.

- Entrance Tank

  - Trash racks
  - Linear flow orifice meter

- Flocculator

  - Baffle modules

- Clarifier

  - Inlet manifold
  - Plate settler support frame

.. _heading_Hydraulic_and_Process_Design_Calculations:

Task 2.7 Hydraulic and Process Design Calculations
--------------------------------------------------

A report detailing the hydraulic and process design calculations will connect the design equations to this specific design and provide the basis of design and relevant calculations for all of the included unit processes.

.. _heading_Webinars:

Task 2.8 Webinars
-----------------

ACR will provide the following remote hour-long webinars for IP staff

- AguaClara: flow through the plant and treatment process overview

- Introduction to Onshape (and why ACR chose Onshape as the platform for our designs)

- AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine: from a parts database, process physics, and geometric constraints to a 3-D model and a bill of materials

Additional webinars can be requested if needed.

.. _heading_Phase_2_Assumptions:

Phase 2 Assumptions
-------------------

IP will be responsible for the following tasks.

Staffing
~~~~~~~~

- The IP will facilitate support with any necessary visas in preparation for Phase 3.

- The IP will provide plant operators from the start of construction through commissioning to work with the APP AguaClara technician.

Structural and Architectural Design, Site Constraints, and Access Road
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The IP will provide final thickness (and possibly unit costs) of structural elements as required by the hydraulic design. These will include slabs, suspended slabs, tank walls for various water depths, and weirs. ACR will add these items to our parts database for customization of the hydraulic design for IP.

- The IP will inform ACR of any site constraints that would influence plant layout.

- The IP will design an access road and a temporary construction site building to store construction materials.

- The IP will create the structural and architectural design.

- The IP will create the required construction and fabrication drawings from the Onshape model provided by ACR. The Onshape model can either be exported for use in other CAD programs or the drawings can be created directly in Onshape.

AguaClara plants require a full building enclosure, built according to local code and structural, electrical, mechanical and other considerations appropriate to the locale. The enclosure serves to extend the life of the components and to provide a safe work environment for the plant operators. The enclosure will protect:

- the hydraulic components from direct sunlight that would degrade the plastics;

- the plant operators from adverse weather and intruders;

- the granular coagulants from rain; and

- the clarifier with a floc filter from sunlight, wind, and rain that would cause thermal/density currents and increase the clarified water turbidity.

Material Sourcing for Construction and Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP will prepare to source construction materials, chemicals including the coagulant and calcium hypochlorite required for plant operations, and required water quality meters (at minimum a portable turbidity meter).

.. _heading_Construction:

Phase 3 - Construction, Installation, Training, Commissioning
=============================================================

.. _heading_Project_Staffing:

Task 3.1 Project Staffing
-------------------------

There are several areas of specialized knowledge for Phase 3, as detailed in :numref:`table_Expertise`, that can most effectively be transferred to IP by experienced staff who have built AguaClara plants in Central America.

.. _table_Expertise:

.. csv-table:: Expertise required for civil work and hydraulic components
   :header: Role, Time period, Area of expertise
   :align: left
   :widths: 12 30 50


   Construction advisor, "Before filter foundation is poured until permanent components are complete", "Construction methods for permanent treatment-related structures (weirs, hoppers, jet reverser, etc.)"
   AguaClara technician, "Before operator training begins until 2 months after plant startup", "

   - Help to set up the workshop

   - Supervise the fabrication and installation of removable hydraulic components (plate settler modules, diffusers, filter modules, etc.)

   - Train plant operators

   - Supervise the plant startup"

Construction Advisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The construction advisor will be an advisor to the IP foreman who is responsible for the work. The construction advisor will provide guidance for construction techniques, order of operations, and the details required for the civil and structural work. The construction advisor will ensure that the civil and structural work match the requirements of the permanent hydraulic components and that both match the requirements of the removable hydraulic components.

AguaClara Technician
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AguaClara technician will supervise fabrication of the removable hydraulic components, such as the chemical dosing system and flocculator modules. The IP must provide all tools and labor for fabrication. The time and personnel requirements for fabrication of the removable hydraulic components will depend on the size of the treatment plant designed.

The AguaClara technician will train community members to operate the AguaClara plant. If the country where the project is being implemented has a relevant water treatment plant operator certification process which the trainees have not yet completed, the IP should arrange for them to also receive that training. The AguaClara training and the country specific certification training will ideally occur simultaneously. ACR recommends that the IP provide a minimum of 5 operators for training to be able to provide 24/7 plant operation. In addition to the personnel who are expected to operate the plant, ACR recommends training additional potential operators to prepare for staff transitions and also other staff from the entity (water board or municipality for instance) that will manage the plant.

.. _heading_Material_Acquisition_Support:

Task 3.2  Material Acquisition Support
--------------------------------------

ACR will provide vendor and part numbers for hydraulic components of the plant and will review alternatives proposed by IP.

There are several specialized components (pipe molds, constant head tank for the chemical feeds, and doser system) that could either be purchased directly from specialty parts suppliers or potentially could be purchased from ACR. ACR will work with IP to determine which approach is best.

.. _heading_Remote_Technical_Support:

Task 3.3 Remote Technical Support
---------------------------------

In addition to the construction advisor and AguaClara technician, ACR will provide remote technical support throughout Phase 3 and for the first year of operation. IP can invite ACR staff to relevant meetings and can contact ACR with questions that arise during the construction phase and the first year of operation.

.. _heading_Webinars_for_Water_Professionals:

Task 3.4 Webinars for Water Professionals
-----------------------------------------

ACR will provide the following remote hour-long training sessions (total of 5 hours) for water professionals

- Chemical Dosing
- Flocculation
- Floc Filters
- Plate Settlers
- Stacked Rapid Sand Filters

This training could be exclusively for IP staff or it could be extended to include water professionals from the region. ACR also welcomes IP recommendations for additional training.

.. _heading_Phase_3_Assumptions:

Phase 3 Assumptions
-------------------

Staffing
~~~~~~~~

- IP will identify individuals that they want to be trained as construction foreman and AguaClara technician so that IP has these capabilities in-house for future projects.

- IP plant operators will be responsible for plant operation as soon as the plant begins operating. This includes during the initial startup and commissioning.

Transport to site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IP will provide transport to the worksite for APP staff.

Material acquisition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- IP will be responsible for acquiring materials for both the civil work and for the hydraulic components.

- IP will be responsible for acquiring the tools as detailed in :ref:`heading_Tool_List_for_Fabrication`.

- IP is responsible for all freight, customs and duty charges.

Fabrication Workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP will provide an enclosed space where the tools (see :ref:`heading_Tool_List_for_Fabrication`) can be setup and the hydraulic components can be fabricated. The workshop can either be adjoining the plant construction site or it can be at a more convenient location for electricity and for the workers. The workshop will be used to assemble hydraulic components including flocculator baffle modules, settler modules, manifolds, and filter piping. The workshop should have dimensions of at least 12 m x 5 m and will require electricity and lighting.

Access Road
~~~~~~~~~~~

IP shall provide an access road to facilitate construction and operations.

Electricity
~~~~~~~~~~~

Construction activities require electricity for:

- power tools

- lighting

- charging batteries

Although AguaClara plants can be operated off-grid there are several critical power requirements for operation:

- Lighting for nighttime operations

- Charging station for cell phones

- Backwash recycle (option that ACR recommends if there are water shortages in the dry season).

The electricity needs for operation could be met by connecting the plant to the electrical grid or by adding solar panels to the roof. IP is responsible for selecting and installing the best option. 

Emergency operation without power could be facilitated by discontinuing backwash recycle. IP is responsible for provision of emergency lighting during power failures.
