Generate New Models of the Chemical Dose Controller
===================================================

Edit the configurations to create new models of the chemical dose controller. Send us `feedback to share how you are using the doser model, to give us suggestions for how to make these models easier to use, and to <https://forms.gle/cqDPapYkcSmLnDu4A>`_ |reportabug|.
