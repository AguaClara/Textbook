The AguaClara Infrastructure Design Engine (AIDE) is created and maintained by AguaClara Reach in `Onshape <https://www.onshape.com/en/>`_.  It represents continuous development since 2005 and the effort of thousands of individuals. AguaClara Reach is providing open access to AIDE and we rely on donor support and payment from AguaClara implementation partners for our services. Please consider `supporting our mission of developing and providing the next generation of drinking water treatment plant design so that many more communities can have safe water on tap <https://www.aguaclarareach.org/donate-now>`_.

AIDE uses parametric design, a part studio tree, and a parts database to generate 3-D models of AguaClara water treatment plants and their Smart Part Components. The part studio tree architecture makes it possible to pass design parameters between Smart Parts and thus achieve an integrated design. Part dimensions and other parameters can be optimized to achieve a compact plant layout.

The following AIDE Smart Parts are provided for education and as a demonstration of the AguaClara Reach ability to provide customized designs to AguaClara implementation partners. The AIDE Smart Parts are not engineering designs. AguaClara Reach uses AIDE Smart Parts, expertise in drinking water treatment, and site specific conditions detailed by AguaClara Implementation Partners to develop customized designs for community scale water treatment plants.

If you do not yet have an Onshape account, then you will be able to make changes to the configuration of the Smart Parts by using the `view only toolbar <https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/viewonlytoolbar.htm>`_. You can sign up for a `free public Onshape account <https://www.onshape.com/en/products/free>`_ that will enable you to access the parts lists and ESTIMATED materials cost for each of the AIDE Smart Parts.
