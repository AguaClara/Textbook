How to use this file:
=====================
Open the source code of the file next to the rendered code. The source code is
found by clicking "View page source" at the top of the page. Next, follow along with the
source code and rendered code. When you want to use the source code

* Always have a clear, informative title, as seen above.
* For headings, use the following
    + \* with overline, for sections
    + = for sections
    + -, for subsections
    + ^, for subsubsections
    + â€œ, for subsubsubsections

* When writing code, :code:`use an inline code block` or a

    .. code::

      code block

* Figures...

    .. figure:: https://www.catster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/A-fluffy-cat-looking-funny-surprised-or-concerned.jpg
        :width: 200px
        :align: center
        :height: 100px
        :alt: external figure

        always need captions and alt-text. And this is an external (url) figure.

    .. _mountain:
    .. figure:: mountain.jpg
        :width: 300px
        :align: center
        :alt: internal figure

        Here is an internally referenced figure. Specify folders with folder/image.jpg


* Math is very cool, and works natively in rst:

  .. math::
     :label: quadratic

        y   = ax^2 + bx + c \\

  .. math::

     n_{\rm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} s_k n_k

* Tables should be made using csv pasted in:

  .. _an_example_table:
  .. csv-table:: Example Table
   :header: "name", "firstname", "age"
   :widths: 20, 20, 10

   "Smith", "John", 40
   "Smith", "John, Junior", 20
* References work by referencing any "target." This can be a figure :numref:`mountain`, equation :eq:`quadratic`,
  or table :numref:`an_example_table`.
* Colored :red:`text`. Add colors/styles by using roles defined in /conf.py and /_static/css/custom.css.
* Test some python code with doctests. To test the code, run :code:`make doctest` as described `here <http://docs.sphinxdocs.com/en/latest/step-3.html>`_. In the linked document, there are many more options for controlling doctest behavior.

    >>> python="code"
    >>> print(5+14)
    19

* You can even print and test tables in doctests:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> names_male = pd.Series(['Obama', 'Monroe', 'Jack'])
    >>> names_female = pd.Series(['Michelle', 'Juanita', 'Jill'])
    >>> var_names = dict( female_names = names_female, male_names = names_male)
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(var_names)
    >>> print(df)
      female_names male_names
    0     Michelle      Obama
    1      Juanita     Monroe
    2         Jill       Jack

* To get doctests to pass through Travis, you'll have to add any packages you use to the install step in ".travis.yml". Under install, add a line that says :code:`pip install my_package==0.0.0`. When doing this, make sure to specify the version as functionality can change!
