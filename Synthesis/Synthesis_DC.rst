Synthesis Design Challenges
***************************

#. Compare the hydraulic residence times for flocculation and sedimentation for AguaClara technologies and the leading commercially available clarification systems.
#. What design changes would you make to the Superpulsator to improve its performance? What improvements in performance and maintenance  would your changes make? Would you recommend upgrading existing Superpulsator plants with your proposed changes?
#. Analyze the data in Jesus_de_Otoro_data.tsv. A useful way to plot water treatment plant performance data is to plot the turbidity (raw, settled, filtered) as a function of the rank of each of those data sets. Determine the fraction of the filtered and settled water samples that met the Honduran standard of 5 NTU and the USEPA standard of 0.3 NTU. (Switch this to POST data when possible.)
