<p>Particle aggregation is the fundamental mechanism that facilitates ultra low energy and low cost removal of particles and pathogens from water. Aggregation requires successful collisions. Success is defined by particles  attaching when they collide.</p>

<h3>Key understanding: coagulant nanoparticles are sticky<a class="headerlink" href="#key-understanding-coagulant-nanoparticles-are-sticky" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prior to the AguaClara flocculation model it was widely assumed that attachment was made possible by reducing the net surface charge of the particles. The AguaClara flocculation model is based on the understanding that coagulant nanoparticles are sticky and are much larger than the length scale of the repulsive forces due to surface charges. Thus surface charge is largely irrelevant and this explains why particle aggregation begins even with very low dosages of coagulant.</p>

<div class="section" id="key-understanding-particles-follow-the-fluid">
<h3>Key understanding: Particles follow the fluid<a class="headerlink" href="#key-understanding-particles-follow-the-fluid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The collisions are caused by particles having relative motion due to fluid deformation. Particle trajectories can be different from the fluid trajectory if the density of the fluid and the particle are significantly different and if the viscous effects are small compared with inertial effects (the Stokes number). The motion of primary particles and small flocs in surface water treatment have low Stokes numbers and follow the fluid trajectory.</p>

<h3>Key understanding: Long range transport is the slow part of the collision process<a class="headerlink" href="#key-understanding-long-range-transport-is-the-slow-part-of-the-collision-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need to calculate the rate of primary particle collisions. In turbulent flow flocculators the fluid deformation is caused by turbulent eddies that lose their energy to viscosity. The relative motion of particles would appear somewhat random as the small eddies have ever changing orientation and intensity. The result is that primary particles take a long meandering path before they finally approach each other and connect in a final collision. The path of relative motion prior to the collision can be thought of as having two distinct components.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The first component is long range transport when the particles are far apart with a separation distance that is proportional to the average distance between particles.</li>
<li>The second component is the short range transport at length scales less than the average particle separation distance to the final collision</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The AguaClara flocculation model assumes a relatively high velocity and long distance random walk clearing a volume of fluid equal to the volume occupied by a single particle. This is followed by a slow, short, straight walk toward a collision. The insight that the long range transport is the rate limiting step will be used to estimate the time required for particle collisions.</p>

<div class="section" id="key-understanding-primary-particles-can-t-attach-to-large-flocs-during-flocculation">
<h3>Key understanding: Primary particles can’t attach to large flocs during Flocculation<a class="headerlink" href="#key-understanding-primary-particles-can-t-attach-to-large-flocs-during-flocculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In our early modeling work we assumed that collisions between primary particles and large flocs were favorable. This assumption led to the prediction that the highest quality water should be obtained when the raw water has the highest turbidity. That prediction is inconsistent with observations and led to the insight that during flocculation, primary particles are only able to collide successfully with other primary particles (or potentially with other very small flocs).</p>
<p>The only transport mechanism that could cause a clay particle to collide with a large floc is the fluid deformation caused by the linear velocity gradient. In our flocculators that linear velocity gradient is caused by turbulent eddies at much larger scales of the flow. We hypothesize that primary particles can not attach to large flocs because primary particles can not collide with large flocs! To understand why this collision is impossible, we need a simple insight.</p>
<p>The insight is that the large flocs drag fluid around as they rotate (due to the linear velocity gradient). The viscous layer around the large flocs creates a flow field in which there is no location far from the flocs that will eventually approach the surface of the flocs or even approach within the clay particle radius. If this is correct, then clay particles never collide with large flocs in a linear velocity gradient flow field.</p>

<p>Particle separation distance matters because it determines which transport mechanisms are at play when two particles approach for a collision. The particle separation distance is a function of the particle concentration. Surface water treatment plants commonly treat water with turbidity between 1 and 1000 NTU. We will first find the number of clay particles per liter in typical raw water suspensions.</p>

<p>Given this range of particle separation distances the next question is whether transport of these particles relative to each other is driven by inertial or viscous dominated processes. Turbulent eddies devolve into smaller and smaller eddies until viscosity finally kills them. Viscosity damps out the effects of inertia at the inner viscous length scale.  Higher intensity turbulence can generate more energetic small eddies and can resist the effects of viscosity longer. Thus the inner viscous length scale decreases as the turbulent energy dissipation rate increases.</p>

<p>Now that we know that the collisions are controlled by viscosity we can begin formulating a model that describes the long distance random walk. The long range transport is assumed to be the rate limiting step. We model a system of two particles where one particle is held fixed and we observe the second particle’s random motion. It may be helpful to visualize this by playing the video inside your mind in reverse starting from the moment of the collision. That way you know which two particles to follow!

<p>We use dimensional analysis to get a relative velocity for the long range transport controlled by shear. The relative velocity between the two particles that will eventually collide is assumed to be proportional to the average distance between the two particles.</p>
<p>The assumption that the relative velocity scales with the average distance between clay particles leads to the following steps. The first step is just a proposed functional relationship.

<p>In summary, a relationship for the mean time between collisions <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t_{c}}\)</span> was found by proposing an average condition for a collision, successful or unsuccessful, to occur. To define this condition, it was assumed that each primary particle on average occupies a fraction of the reactor volume, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_{Surround}\)</span>, inversely proportional to the number concentration of particles. Furthermore, prior to a collision, a particle on average sweeps a volume, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_{Cleared}\)</span>, proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t_c}\)</span> and to the mean relative velocity between approaching particles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{v}_r\)</span>. As an average condition, it was posited that for each collision, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_{Cleared}\)</span> must equal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_{Surround}\)</span>.

<p>The probability that two primary particles attach is expected to be equal to the probability that at least one of the colliding particles has a precipitated coagulant nanoparticle at the initial contact point. It is simpler to derive the probability of attachment from the probability that neither particle has a coagulant nanoparticle at the point where the two particles collide, since the probability of a successful collision includes the probabilities of one particle and of both particles having a coagulant precipitate. The probability of one particle colliding at a point without a coagulant precipitate is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1-\bar{\Gamma})\)</span>, so the probability of neither particle having a coagulant precipitate at the point of collision is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1-\bar{\Gamma})^2\)</span>. As this is the probability of a failed collision, the probability of a successful collision is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-(1-\bar{\Gamma})^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the model assumes an initially monodisperse population of primary particles and that collisions between differently-sized particles are unfavorable, differential sedimentation is considered negligible.

<p>Continuing from <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-pennock-theoretical-2016" id="id3">[PCWSL16]</a>, the above Lagrangian differential relationships are further developed to become integrated performance prediction equations. Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ncld">(399)</a> cannot be integrated as written because the concentration of primary particles is expected to change with each collision, and thus that relationship must be specified. During the average time required for one collision it is expected that approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e^{-1}\)</span> of the particles will undergo at least one collision. The time required for a collision will change as flocculation proceeds as the average distance between primary particles increases. The rate of loss of primary particles due to successful collisions will be first order with respect to the number of successful collisions.</p>

Physically, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-dcp">(400)</a> states that, with each progressive primary particle collision, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span> decreases by some proportion. Further, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-dcp">(400)</a> states that this decrease is directly proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span>. With each successive successful collision, the absolute reduction in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span> is less than the prior one. The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is expected to be less than 1, because not all primary particles will have a collision and grow to a size with a sedimentation velocity greater than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c\)</span> in the average time required for a collision.</p>
<p>Having Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-dcp">(400)</a>, the next step is to substitute it into Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ncld">(399)</a> and integrate.

<p>It is interesting to note that rearranging Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-dcplam">(401)</a> in terms of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{dC_P}{dt}\)</span> gives a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span> exponent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{5}{3}\)</span>. Previous flocculation rate equations were second-order, but the observed flocculation rate was less than second-order <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-benjamin-water-2013" id="id4">[BL13]</a>. The slight deviation from an exponent of two comes from the assumption of <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-pennock-theoretical-2016" id="id5">[PCWSL16]</a> that relative velocity between colliding particles scales with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span> rather than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_P\)</span>. This is to say that, in dilute suspensions characteristic of raw water, where particles are separated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \Lambda\gg \bar{d}_P\)</span>, the majority of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{t_c}\)</span> is spent with the distance between particles characterized by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \Lambda\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{d}_P\)</span>. The time required for the final approach for a collision is hypothesized to be insignificant compared the time for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_Cleared\)</span> to equal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{V}_Surround\)</span>.</p>
<p>From Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-dcplam">(401)</a> it is possible to integrate and obtain equations for flocculation performance. After separation of variables, one side of the equation is integrated with respect to time from the initial time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>) to the time of interest, generally taken to be the mean hydraulic residence time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=\theta\)</span>). The other side of the equation is integrated with respect to the concentration of primary particles from the value at the initial time (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{P_0}\)</span>), equivalent to the initial concentration of primary particles, to the concentration of primary particles at the time of interest (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{P}\)</span>). The integral becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-intdcplam">
<span class="eqno">(402)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-intdcplam" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[       \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\rho_{P}\frac{\pi}{6}\right)^{2/3}\int_{C_{P_0}}^{C_{P}}C_{P}^{-5/3}dC_{P}=-k\bar{\alpha}\bar G_{CS}\int_0^\theta dt.\]</div>
<p>The integral on the left hand side assumes that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{P}\)</span> does not change as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span> changes. One assumption on the right side is that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span>, of which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\alpha}\)</span> is a function, does not vary with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. This requires that adsorption of coagulant to colloidal particles in rapid mix be fast enough to be approximated as completed by the beginning of flocculation. This assumption may not be valid for high rate flocculators especially under conditions of low <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{P_0}\)</span>. Further work on the rate and efficacy of coagulant nanoparticle attachment to primary particle surfaces is needed.</p>
<p>The other assumption on the right hand side is that the mean velocity gradient, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\)</span>, does not change over the course of the flocculation process. In mechanically-mixed flocculators, the use of a simple spatial average is not reasonable, as the velocity gradient changes dramatically from the bulk flow to the tip of the impeller blade and individual particles follow different paths that expose them to different velocity gradient zones in different sequences and durations <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-boller-particles-1998" id="id6">[BB98]</a>. The distribution of residence times in a mechanical flocculator would also need to be taken into account for the integration. For baffled hydraulic flocculators, on the other hand, the use of the spatial average, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\)</span>, and considering it constant with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is generally a reasonable approximation, as mixing energy in a well-designed hydraulic flocculator is rather uniformly distributed spatially, the zones of higher energy dissipation rate after the baffles do not vary appreciably with time when operating at a constant flow rate, and all particles have similar residence times in the flocculator.</p>

<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-gtlam">(404)</a> gives guidance for flocculator design in that higher values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\theta\)</span> are needed for flocculators to achieve greater changes in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \Lambda\)</span> (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_P\)</span>) or to overcome low <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span>.

In this case the initial particle separation distance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \Lambda_0\)</span> can be considered negligible.

<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-pclam">(408)</a> was tested under turbulent conditions. The design scheme chosen to meet these requirements was a tube flocculator, illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-apparatus"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 97</span></a> and described in <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-pennock-theoretical-2016" id="id8">[PCWSL16]</a>.

The change in mean energy dissipation rate due to any modification to the system was approximated by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-edr">
<span class="eqno">(409)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-edr" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[       \bar{\varepsilon}=\frac{gh_\ell}{\theta},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration due to gravitational force and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_\ell\)</span> is the head loss across the flocculator. As mentioned previously, the use of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \varepsilon\)</span> assumes that the energy dissipation rate throughout the flocculator is completely uniform so that it can be represented with a simple spatial average rather than a weighted average accounting for the proportion of the flow passing through different zones of energy dissipation rate. This approximation requires that the majority of energy dissipation (represented by head loss) is due to fluid shear (minor loss) in the bulk flow. If the head loss across a flocculator were primarily as a result of shear on the reactor walls (major loss), only a small fraction of the flow would experience this energy dissipation rate in the near-wall zone, and estimating the mean energy dissipation rate by this method would be invalid.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized, however, that the constrictions in the tube flocculator created submerged free jets downstream, generating fluid shear across the cross section of the flow <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-pennock-theoretical-2016" id="id10">[PCWSL16]</a>. This hypothesis is supported by a calculation of the head loss due to wall shear using the Darcy-Weisbach Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-granger-fluid-1995" id="id11">[Gra95]</a>. The turbulent tube flocculator would be expected to have a total head loss of around 7 cm if only wall shear were present, but an average head loss of 90 cm was measured across the flocculator by means of a differential pressure sensor, indicating that significant fluid shear is present.</p>
<p>Referring to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-edr">(409)</a>, changing the head loss by changing the constriction of the tubes or changing the water elevation difference across the flocculator would change the energy dissipation rate. Likewise, either of the above two modifications would change the mean hydraulic residence time in the flocculator. This could also be accomplished by changing the length of the flocculator.</p>

</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#figure-apparatus"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 97</span></a> illustrates the process sequence used in this study. At the beginning of the process, tap water from the Cornell University Water Filtration Plant came into the system with, on average, a pH of 7.67, a turbidity of 0.056 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), a total hardness of 150 mg/L, a total alkalinity of 140 mg/L, and a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of 1.80 mg/L <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-bp-mws-drinking-2016" id="id13">[BPMWSCIWSCUWS16]</a>. This water was temperature-controlled by means of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, which regulated the relative fractions of hot water and cold water used to maintain the level in the constant head tank. The temperature-controlled water was passed through a granular activated carbon (GAC) filter to reduce the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on experimental results. The water was then sent to the constant head tank, where it was bubbled with air to strip out supersaturated dissolved gases that might come out of solution during the experiment, resulting in formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>From the constant head tank, this conditioned water was delivered to the turbulent tube flocculator. Before entry to the flocculator, the water was set at a constant primary particle concentration by means of a computer-controlled peristaltic pump that introduced a concentrated kaolinite clay suspension (R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc., Norwalk, Connecticut) of about 250 g/L. A fraction of the mixed flow was sampled by a peristaltic pump and analyzed for turbidity with an HF Scientific MicroTOL turbidimeter at a distance of greater than ten diameters downstream from the clay input and then reintroduced at the point where clay suspension was added. This turbidity reading was input into a PID control system which determined the speed of the clay pump according to the discrepancy between the influent turbidity and the experimental target value.</p>
<p>Along with the clay, strong base (NaOH) manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) was added upstream of the flocculator with a peristaltic pump to keep the pH of the water at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.5\pm0.5\)</span>, which was the criterion set for the pH in these experiments. In the winter, the pH of the tap water dropped close to 7, and so sufficient NaOH was added to account for seasonal variations in the natural base-neutralizing capacity (BNC) of the water and to raise the pH above 7 to around 7.5.  This base addition was also sufficient to neutralize the acidity of the polyaluminum chloride (PACl) coagulant used for this study, which had been found to impact the solubility of PACl at high doses. Base doses were calculated to account for the normality of the PACl solution, based on a titration which found that the PACl solution was approximately 0.025 equivalents of strong acid per gram as Al.</p>
<p>Just prior to entering the flocculator,  PACl coagulant (PCH-180) manufactured by the Holland Company, Inc. (Adams, Massachusetts) was added to the flow by a computer-controlled peristaltic pump which varied the coagulant dose between experiments. After entering the system, the coagulant then entered a small orifice used to accomplish rapid mix by forming a jet downstream. From there, the suspension traveled up through the flocculator made of 3.18 cm (1.25 in) inner diameter tubing. Within the flocculator, the fluid passed through constrictions in the tubing that caused the flow to contract, resulting in flow expansions afterward and achieving increased mixing and energy dissipation.</p>
<p>After leaving the flocculator, the flow passed a vertical tube with a free surface that served as an air release. This removed bubbles in the system so that they would not interfere with settling or analysis of the flocs. A portion of the flow was then diverted for sedimentation by means of a peristaltic pump up a clear one-inch PVC pipe angled at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{\circ}\)</span>. The flow rate through the pump was selected based on the dimensions of the tube and its angle to achieve a desired capture velocity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c\)</span>. The supernatant from this tube settler was passed through an HF Scientific MicroTOL nephelometric turbidimeter to record the effluent turbidity for the duration of the experiment. Recording the settled effluent turbidity made it possible to calculate the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(pC^*\)</span> term in Equations <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-pclam">(408)</a> (in terms of primary particles) and also made possible comparison with data from <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-swetland-flocculation-sedimentation-2014" id="id14">[SWSL14]</a>.</p>
<p>After data from the settled flocs had been collected, the flow from the effluent turbidimeter was sent to the drain along with the bulk flow. The bulk flow traveled past a second air release before exiting the drain. The air release gave the flow exiting the drain a free surface as it flowed over the exit weir so that the exiting water developed into a supercritical flow. Thus, the flow over the weir was not influenced by the flow downstream of the free surface, and the flow rate could be controlled by adjusting the elevation of the free surface before the drain. The outlet weir was a 1-1/4” PVC pipe within an upright 3” clear pipe, which were joined by a flexible coupling adapter. The effluent water accumulated in the clear outer pipe until it reached the elevation of the top of the inner pipe and flowed down through it. The flow rate could be adjusted by loosening the flexible coupling so that the elevation of the top of the inner pipe could be adjusted. As the bulk flow exited down out of the inner pipe to the drain, it passed over a glass electrode sensor to
measure pH.</p>

<p>The above process was used to conduct the experiments to test the applicability of Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-pclam">(408)</a> in turbulent flocculation. The influent turbidity was set at a constant of 900 NTU. The mean energy dissipation rate was about 21.5 mW/kg, which resulted from choosing a flow rate of about 110 mL/s so that the Reynolds number was just above 4,000. These values were chosen to ensure viscous-dominated turbulent initial conditions. For these experiments, coagulant doses ranged from 0.05 to 98 mg/L as Al. A <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c\)</span> of 0.12 mm/s was used for all experiments.

<h3>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The goodness of fit seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pennockfig3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 99</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pennockfig5"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 100</span></a> indicate that the model captures the important mechanisms governing flocculation performance for a wide range of coagulant doses in both laminar and turbulent hydraulic flocculation. One of the challenges in fitting the data pertained to the assumption made for the characteristic diameter of PACl precipitate clusters, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{d}_C\)</span>. This value has significant influence on the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span>, which in turn influences the values of the composite parameter (Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-paramlam">(410)</a>).</p>
<p>It is known that PACl contains aluminum monomers and oligomers as well as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{Al_{13}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{Al_{30}}\)</span> nanoclusters, with the larger <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{Al_{30}}\)</span> nanoclusters having a diameter of 1 nm and a length of 2 nm <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-mertens-polyaluminum-2012" id="id22">[MCM+12]</a>. It has been found, however, that the components of PACl self-aggregate and go on to form larger clusters <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-swetland-influence-2013" id="id23">[SWSL13]</a>. For these experiments, the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{d}_\mathrm{C}\)</span> was chosen based on sizing experiments performed by Garland (2017) with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS to analyze a 138.5 mg/L (as Aluminum) solution of PACl.</p>
<p>A limitation of the model can be seen in the data in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pennockfig3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 99</span></a> at higher values of the composite parameters. After increasing steadily for all of the preceding range of coagulant doses, the performance began to decline after the dose of 10.9 mg/L as Aluminum. A simple hypothesis for the decline in performance (which corresponds with an effluent turbidity increase over the five data points from 2.7 NTU to 11.1 NTU) is that an increase in free PACl nanoparticles made a significant contribution to the effluent turbidity. As the PACl concentration increased, the coverage of reactor and clay platelet surfaces by coagulant became more complete and the free coagulant concentration also increased. With very high coagulant doses like the ones used in the upper end of the experimental range, it is possible that the formation of PACl self-aggregates was favorable, increasing the turbidity of the suspension. Indeed, calculation of the volume fraction for the 10.9 mg/L experimental PACl dose gives a volume fraction value (for clay and coagulant combined) of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6.1\times10^{-4}\)</span>, while for the highest dose of 98 mg/L as Al, the value was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.3\times10^{-4}\)</span>, a 37% increase due solely to the increased contribution of PACl precipitates.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span> increases above 0.5, the resulting flocs are increasingly formed by PACl-PACl bonds instead of by PACl-kaolinite bonds. If the PACl-PACl bonds are weaker than PACl-kaolinite bonds, it is possible that attachment efficiency decreases for high <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span>. The weakness of PACl-PACl bonds compared with PACl-kaolinite bonds is suggested by the relative charges of PACl and kaolinite. While PACl precipitate surfaces are positively charged, the surfaces of kaolinite are mostly negatively charged <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-wei-coagulation-2015" id="id24">[WZL+15]</a>. Therefore, it follows that PACl precipitates will likely have more affinity for kaolinite surfaces than for other PACl precipitates. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\Gamma}\)</span> calculated for the peak performance was 0.52, and so it is possible that performance decreased past this point because the strength of bonds for experiments at higher doses were weaker.</p>
<p>Applying the AguaClara flocculation model to the design of a hydraulic flocculator indeed gives reasonable results. Assuming that a flocculator is expected to receive sufficiently high turbidities that the influent concentration can be neglected, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-gtlamsim">(405)</a> can be used. In order for it to treat to a settled effluent of 3 NTU (pre-filtration) with sufficient PACl to achieve a surface area coverage fraction of 0.5, it would need to have a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\theta\)</span> of 99,600. <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-davis-introduction-2008" id="id25">[DC08]</a> give the range of  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\theta\)</span> values pertinent to flocculation of high turbidities as between 36,000 and 96,000, so this result is reasonable. This analysis does not account for removal of particles in a floc blanket that would enable use of a lower value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\theta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Regarding flocculator design, recommended values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\)</span> in flocculation range from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\:\mathrm{\frac{1}{s}}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\:\mathrm{\frac{1}{s}}\)</span>, which correspond to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\varepsilon}\)</span> values of about 0.1 to 10 mW/kg <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-mcconnachie-design-2000" id="id26">[ML00]</a>. However, there is evidence that higher velocity gradients are advantageous, as found by <a class="reference internal" href="#floc-model-garland-revisiting-2016" id="id27">[GWSL16]</a> as well as the work done in this study, which made use of energy dissipation rates of about 22 mW/kg. For hydraulic flocculators, at least, designers should consider using higher energy dissipation rates than conventionally used, since they have a much lower ratio of maximum to average energy dissipation rate, leading to less floc breakup at high energy dissipation rates compared to mechanically mixed flocculators.</p>
<p>The assumption that nonsettleable particle removal is proportional to primary particle removal appears to be supported by the goodness of fit supplied by the AguaClara  flocculation model to the data (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-pennockfig3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 99</span></a>). This assumption is likely included in the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> fit by the model. A mechanistic understanding of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> will require that the proportionality between nonsettleable and primary particles be understood explicitly. It is possible that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> is a function of rapid mix effectiveness, and since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> predicts <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(pC^*\)</span>, it will also be dependent on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c\)</span>. Future experiments at varying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_c\)</span> are planned. Currently, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\alpha}\)</span> is calculated assuming that coagulant nanoparticle attachment to the primary particles was accomplished very early on in the flocculator, but if colloid coating by coagulant nanoparticles is dependent upon diffusion rather than exclusively on hydraulic shear, it will be a function of time in addition to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\theta\)</span>, making flocculation less effective at high flow rates. Additionally, the use of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\varepsilon}\)</span> (or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar G_{CS}\)</span>) assumes a uniform energy dissipation rate in the flocculator. Any spatial deviation in the laboratory flocculator from a uniform energy dissipation rate would have had an impact on the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> relative to their theoretical values, which are dictated by the rate of conversion of primary particles to flocs.</p>

Until further work is done on delineating the relative predominance of viscous and inertial forces over the range of turbulent flocculation conditions, the authors recommend using the AguaClara flocculation model. For design purposes, this model indicates that flocculator design is more sensitive to the desired effluent concentration of particles than the range of influent concentrations that might be encountered. This study also supports the use of higher energy dissipation rates (or velocity gradients) than conventionally recommended for hydraulic flocculators.

<h2>Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid on Flocculation<a class="headerlink" href="#geometric-explanation-of-the-effects-of-humic-acid-on-flocculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous in natural waters and has considerable influence on drinking water treatment, since the presence of DOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in addition to being a precursor of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). This work evaluated use of polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as a coagulant for a synthetic water to determine the effect of DOM on the settled effluent turbidity. The research employed the hydraulic flocculation performance model previously discussed and made additions to the model algorithm to incorporate the effects of humic acid on flocculation of inorganic particulate matter. Data were obtained using a laminar-flow tube flocculator and a lamellar tube settler. Two adjustable model parameters were used to fit data, one related to the capture velocity used for sedimentation, and one that estimated the average size of dissolved humic acid molecules. The modified model that accounted for the presence of humic acid was able to independently predict the experimental results from 60 experiments at a different influent turbidity. This section is based on <em>Observations and a Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid on Flocculation</em> published in Environmental Engineering Science in 2019 (DOI#10.1089/ees.2018.0405), and the reader is encouraged to consult this article for more details.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Optimal flocculation conditions for turbidity or pathogen removal are not always the same as those for DOM removal (Hua and Reckhow, 2008). Because of the variable composition of DOM, the mechanisms of removal could be different for different types of DOM in water (Sharp and Jarvis, 2006). Jarvis and Jefferson (2007) state that the mechanisms through which DOM is removed include a combination of charge neutralization, adsorption, entrapment, and complexation with coagulant polycations into suspended particulate aggregates. The hydrophobic fraction of DOM, which includes humic acids, is generally removed in coagulation more effectively than the hydrophilic fraction (Marhaba et al., 2003; Matilainen et al., 2010). For the system considered in this research, the mechanisms of DOM (humic acid) attachment to coagulant (PACl with 10.6% Al2O3 w/w and basicity, OH/Al, of 2.1), appear to be adsorption (Yan et al., 2008) or complexation (Lin et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Prehydrolyzed polymer coagulants, such as polyaluminum chloride (PACl), have several advantages over conventional coagulants, such as alum, but the characteristics of the raw water (e.g., pH, alkalinity, and DOM content) affect the performance of different coagulants. As a result, prehydrolyzed coagulants do not consistently improve the removal efficiency of DOM (Hu et al., 2006).</p>
<p>The research described in this paper builds on the AguaClara hydraulic flocculation model developed by Pennock et al. (2018) and adds detail to the attachment efficiency coefficient describing geometric and probabilistic interactions between clay, coagulant, DOM, and reactor walls. The synthetic raw water used in experiments added one type of DOM, humic acid, to a previously studied synthetic system (Swetland et al., 2014) with the expectation that the resulting system would be sufficiently well-characterized to develop a predictive model.</p>

<p>In laminar-flow flocculators, the velocity of one floc relative to another scales with the average separation distance between flocs (Swetland et al., 2014). The time between floc collisions is inversely proportional to both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span> and the relative velocity between flocs. Because the relative velocity between flocs is proportional to separation distance, the time between collisions is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\phi }^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span>, since the average separation distance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline \Lambda\)</span>, is given by</p>

<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-aguaclara-flocculation-model">(412)</a>, referred to as the AguaClara flocculation model in Pennock et al. (2018), is a Lagrangian hydrodynamic model that assumes that the aggregation of primary particles is rate-limiting. It further assumes that these particles, on average, will collide when the volume of fluid swept out as one particle approaches the other is equal to the average volume occupied by a single particle in the suspension. The time for these collisions to occur increases as flocculation proceeds, since the concentration of primary particles decreases in a way that is assumed to be first order with respect to collisions. Thus, with each successive collision, the average volume occupied by primary particles increases, and it takes longer for the next collision to occur. In Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-aguaclara-flocculation-model">(412)</a>, performance is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the effective collision potential, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(\overline{\alpha }\overline G_{CS}\theta {\phi }^{2/3}_0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This group of parameters is the same as the group first described by Swetland et al. (2014), with the exception that they used the estimated fractional coverage of the colloid surface by coagulant, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_{\mathrm{PACl-Clay}}\)</span>, as a measure of attachment efficiency instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{\alpha }\)</span>. Pennock et al. (2018) recognized that surface coverage of both particles participating in a collision matters, and introduced <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{\alpha }\)</span> to convert the geometric information contained in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_{\mathrm{PACl-Clay}}\)</span> to a probability of a successful collision. Using data gathered by Swetland et al. (2014), Pennock et al. (2018) were able to predict the results of independent laminar flocculation experiments with no adjustable parameters in the absence of added DOM.</p>
<p>Experimental results obtained with added humic acid made clear that the attachment efficiency was adversely affected by the addition of humic acid.  Referencing adsorption measurements by Davis (1982), a minority (his study found 20%) of added DOM would be adsorbed by kaolinite at the experimental pH of 7.5. Thus, most humic acid macromolecules were available to attach to the added coagulant nanoparticles. The following simplifying assumptions were made to account for the presence of humic acids: 1) humic acid macromolecules attach to coagulant nanoparticles to form nanoaggregates, 2) nanoaggregates attach to clay and to the reactor walls, and 3) the surfaces of precipitated coagulant nanoparticles promote adhesion, while the surfaces of bound humic acids prevent adhesion.</p>
<p>In this study, humic acid macromolecules and PACl nanoparticles were modeled as spheres. Based on the size of coagulant nanoparticles and humic acid macromolecules, their number concentrations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{\mathrm HA}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{\mathrm PACl}\)</span> respectively, can be estimated by</p>

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{\mathrm PACl}\)</span> is the dose of coagulant in mg/L as Al; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_{\mathrm HA}\)</span> is the concentration of humic acid in mg/L; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\rho }_{\mathrm PACl}\)</span> is the density of the coagulant (Swetland et al.

<p>A key model assumption was that humic acid macromolecules cannot adhere to a coagulant surface that is occupied by a humic acid macromolecule, since humic acid macromolecules are assumed to not appreciably self-aggregate. Li et al. (2018) observed that for humic acid adsorption onto <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{Al_2O_3}\)</span> surfaces, the macromolecules adsorbed in a monolayer. The outcome of this assumption is that humic acid macromolecules attach to an uncovered surface of coagulant and do not stack on top of one another. The available surface area of the PACl nanoparticle was modeled as the surface area of an equivalent sphere. The amount of that area that is occupied by an attached humic acid macromolecule was estimated as the projected area of a sphere with volume equivalent to a humic acid macromolecule.  A new variable describing the coverage of coagulant nanoparticle surface area by humic acid macromolecules,</p>

<p>was created to be incorporated into the model (within <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{\alpha }\)</span>) to represent the fraction of the PACl nanoparticle surface area that is covered by humic acid macromolecules.</p>
<p>The first two steps in particle aggregation, where humic acid macromolecules attach to coagulant nanoparticles and then the resulting nanoaggregates attach to clay surfaces, were assumed to be rapid because diffusion is an effective transport process for nanoparticles (Benjamin and Lawler, 2013). Subsequent to rapid mix, the clay particles with attached nanoaggregates undergo collisions during the flocculation process and the aggregation process is governed by fluid shear (Pennock et al., 2018). The success of a collision between clay particles is hypothesized to be dependent on the properties of the contact surfaces at the initial point of contact.</p>

<p>The model accounting for the presence of humic acids is modified from the Pennock et al. (2018) model by redefining the attachment efficiency, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{\alpha }\)</span>, using Eq. 14 to account for the presence of humic acid.</p>
<p>The physical properties of humic acid vary with composition. The diameter of humic acid macromolecules is estimated to range from 4 nm to 110 nm (“{O}sterberg, 1993). Because of the variation in the size of humic acid macromolecules, the characteristic diameter of the humic acid macromolecules was used as a fitting parameter. Thus, there are two adjustable model parameters, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>,), which accounts for the sedimentation capture velocity, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_\mathrm{HA}\)</span>, which accounts for coagulant precipitate surface coverage by humic acid.  These parameters were fit to results from observations taken with an influent turbidity of 50 NTU; the model was then validated by independently predicting results from experiments with an influent turbidity of 100 NTU.</p>

<h3>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#id29" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The solubility of humic acid is highly pH-dependent, and additional experimental results are needed to test the applicability of the model approach as a function of varying pH. The experimental conditions were designed to keep the pH relatively constant, and the pH change in the experiments was small (7.5 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span> 0.3).</p>
<p>The model considered flocculation in the presence of humic acid as a two-step process. Firstly, humic acid macromolecules attached to precipitated coagulant nanoparticles. Then, the partially-coated coagulant nanoaggregates could bind to clay and reactor wall surfaces.  Humic acid and coagulant nanoparticles were treated as spheres when estimating the attachment efficiency based on surface coverage and probability. The diameter of precipitated PACl nanoparticles was experimentally measured to be 90 nm (Garland, 2017), and a humic acid macromolecule diameter of 75 nm best fit the observations. Wall loss of coagulant precipitates with humic acid nanoaggregates was considered while direct wall loss of humic acid macromolecules was not considered.</p>
<p>The characteristic humic acid dimension, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_\mathrm{HA}\)</span>, has a physical meaning, with the fitted value, 75 nm, falling within the range (4-110 nm) reported by “{O}sterberg (1993), and the model fits are well correlated to the observations. The predictive capability of the model was verified by predicting results under different experimental conditions with no additional adjustable parameters.</p>
<p>The flocculation model without the effects of humic acid shows that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{p}C^*\)</span> is directly proportional to the log of the effective collision potential, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(\overline{\alpha }\overline G_{CS}\theta {\phi }^{\frac{2}{3}})\)</span>, and this relationship is still present in the model with a modified attachment efficiency, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{\alpha },\)</span> based on clay surface coverage by coagulant nanoparticles as adjusted for the presence of humic acids.</p>
<p>The form of the flocculation model equation sets the interactions between raw water properties (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\phi }_0\)</span>), influent particle surface area (which contributes to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_\mathrm{PACl-Clay}\)</span>), coagulant precipitate size and dose (which contributes to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_\mathrm{PACl-Clay}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_\mathrm{HA-PACl}\)</span>) , humic acid molecule size and concentration (which contribute to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_\mathrm{HA-PACl}\)</span>), flocculator design (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline G_{CS}\theta\)</span>), and sedimentation tank design (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>). In a gravity-powered water treatment plant operating at constant flow rate, the flocculator and sedimentation tank parameters are constant. An increase in concentration of humic acid causes an increase in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({\overline{\Gamma}}_\mathrm{HA-PACl}\)</span>, which decreases <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{p}C^*\)</span> but can be compensated for by increasing coagulant dose.</p>
