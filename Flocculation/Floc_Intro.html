<p>Flocculation transform inorganic (clays such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969708010103">kaolinite, smectite, etc. and metallic oxy-hydroxides such as goethite and gibbsite</a>) and organic (viruses, bacteria and protozoa) primary particles into flocs (particle aggregates). Flocculation does not remove any particles from suspension. Instead it causes particle aggregation and then floc filter, lamellar sedimentation, and sand filtration will be used to separate those flocs from the water. Sedimentation can remove flocs more easily than it can remove primary particles because flocs have a higher terminal sedimentation velocity. Floc filters and sand filtration rely primarily on capture based on interception and interception is much more efficient when the particles are larger. Thus the purpose of flocculation is to join <strong>all</strong> of the primary particles together into flocs (See movie in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-collisions-in-sequence"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 95</span></a>).</p>

</div>
<p>The reason that flocculation is widely used in water treatment is because of sedimentation. Sedimentation is the process that actually removes particles like clay, dirt, organic matter, and bacteria from water. As you learned in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../Introduction/Introduction.html#heading-treatment-trains"><span class="std std-ref">introduction on treatment trains</span></a>, sedimentation is the process of particles ‘falling’ because they have a higher density then the water, and its governing equation is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-flocculation-floc-intro-0">
<span class="eqno">(412)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-flocculation-floc-intro-0" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\bar v_t = \frac{D_{particle}^2 g}{18 \nu} \frac{\rho_p - \rho_w}{\rho_w}\]</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Such that:</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_t\)</span> = terminal velocity of a particle, its downwards speed if it were in quiescent (still) water</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{particle}\)</span> = particle diameter</div>
<div class="line"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> = density. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> subscript stands for particle, while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w\)</span> stands for water</div>
</div>
<p>To increase <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar v_t\)</span> and make sedimentation more efficient, flocculation aims to increase the diameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> of the raw particles. This is done by applying a coagulant to the dirty water. Being partially covered by coagulant nanoparticles allows the raw water particles to collide, attach, and grow larger during flocculation.
Our goal in designing a flocculator is to facilitate particle collisions in a compact reactor without generating so much fluid shear that flocs are torn apart.</p>
<div class="section" id="history-of-flocculation">
<h2>History of Flocculation<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-flocculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Historically flocculation was assumed to involve collisions between all particles in the suspension. The Smoluchowski coagulation equation was published in 1916 and uses a population balance approach to track the number of particles of each size based on the probability of collisions between all possible combinations of particle sizes. The Smoluchowski equation is a statement of the conservation of mass and as such it certainly applies to flocculation in drinking water treatment plants. The challenge is that the probability of collisions between all possible combinations of particle sizes must be somehow known in order to use the model. The complexity of obtaining the collision probabilities and the complexity of solving the equation have preventing use of the Smoluchowski equation for design or operation of flocculators. We now know that particles of different sizes are unable to collide due to the interactions of their boundary layers and thus flocculation performance can be modeled by simply tracking the smallest particle concentration rather than attempting to model the concentration of all particle sizes.</p>
<p>For most of the past century there have been two explanations for the particle interactions during flocculation based on the addition of a coagulant. The first explanation was that the positive charge of the coagulant neutralizes the negative charge of naturally occurring particles and thus eliminates the electrostatic repulsion that was preventing aggregation. The second explanation was called sweep flocculation and was the catch all explanation that was used to describe observations that didn’t fit the charge neutralization explanation. Particles were presumed to be swept into a mesh of coagulant precipitate at coagulant dosages that are typically used in drinking water treatment.</p>
<p>The mechanism of particle-particle aggregation was thought to be controlled by the average surface charge. Unfortunately no one was able to develop a model of how that mechanism would influence particle attachment efficiency and no predictive models for flocculation were developed. Indeed, there were several observations that were at odds with the charge neutralization hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Flocculation was observed to be efficient even at coagulant dosages that led to positive surface charge. This unexpected result was attributed to “sweep floc”.</p></li>
<li><p>Flocculation began to be effective even when the surface charge was still negative.</p></li>
<li><p>Flocculation time for highly turbid suspensions was expected to proceed very rapidly and produce very low turbidity settled water. This expectation was not observed and led to the hypothesis that flocs were continually breaking up and producing primary particles or at least very small flocs.</p></li>
<li><p>The floc break up hypotheses led to the expectation that high turbidity suspensions would have significantly higher settled water turbidity than low turbidity suspensions. This expectation was also not observed.</p></li>
<li><p>The coagulant precipitate self aggregates – this is inconsistent with the positive charge that the electrostatic hypothesis asserts will prevent aggregation</p></li>
<li><p>Electrostatic repulsion extends only a few nm from the surface of a particle – and the coagulant nanoparticles are many times larger than the reach of the repulsive electrostatic force. Thus there is no need to neutralize surface charge when using coagulant nanoparticles.</p></li>
<li><p>Charge neutralization explanation neglects to fully account for the presence of water in the system. Water molecules will also be attracted to surfaces by London van der Waals forces and thus there will be competition between particle-particle bonds and water-particle bonds. Thus eliminating repulsion is NOT sufficient to produce a bond between the particles. It is also necessary for the particle-particle bonds to be stronger than the water-particle bonds. (see <a class="reference external" href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/30137/Chapter1.pdf?sequence=9">hydration repulsion, page 21</a>) ` “The theory of DLP was a great step forward in that it appeared to circumvent the whole intractable problem of many body forces through its use of measured bulk dielectric response functions. However, it must be stressed again that it is a perturbation theory. That is, it depends on the assumption that an intervening liquid between interacting surfaces has bulk liquid properties up to a molecular distance from the surfaces. This is thermodynamically inconsistent, being equivalent to the statement that surface energies (or alternatively, the positions of the Gibbs dividing surfaces) are changed infinitesimally with distance of separation. This limits the theory to large distances (Young–Laplace vs. Poisson again) where large is undefined.” &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-8686(99)00008-1">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-8686(99)00008-1</a>&gt;`__</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Evidence that the charge neutralization hypothesis doesn’t explain flocculation of surface waters has been accumulating for decades. <em>Sweep</em> flocculation has been proposed as an alternative “mechanism” that described common observations that didn’t fit the charge neutralization hypothesis. However, similar to the charge neutralization hypothesis, the <em>sweep</em> hypothesis didn’t result in the development of predictive equations to describe the process.</p>
<p>For example, in 1992 Ching, Tanaka, and Elimelech published their research on <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90007-8">Dynamics of coagulation of kaolin particles with ferric chloride</a>. They found that the electrophoretic mobility, a measure of the clay particle surface charge, was never neutralized at pH 7.8 and was neutralized at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\mu M\)</span> at pH 6.0. The results were interpreted by the authors to mean that some combination of sweep floc and charge patchiness was responsible for the observed results.</p>

<h2>Polymers<a class="headerlink" href="#polymers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Synthetic polymers often made with repeating units of acrylic acid and its derivatives are used to aid flocculation by bridging between particles. For polymer bridging to occur the polymer chains must be able to span the length scale of double-layer repulsion. The thickness of the diffuse layer is about 10 nm at an ionic strength of 1 mM (Coagulants and Flocculants: Theory &amp; Practice by Yong Kim, 1995). The length of linear polymers ranges from 100 to 1500 nm (<a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ma00168a023">Table 3 of Ying and Chu, 1987</a>) and thus both synthetic polymers and coagulant nanoparticles can easily span the length scale of double-layer repulsion.</p>
<p>The shortest synthetic polymers are similar in size to the coagulant nanoparticles and the longest synthetic polymers are similar in length to bacteria. These polymers could create additional connections between primary particles and coagulant nanoparticles or they could connect primary particles. In either case the polymers can add connections (more bonds!) that likely have some elasticity and thus there can be more than 3 bonds connecting two particles.</p>
<p>Polymers undoubtedly increase the connections that bind flocs together and thus enable flocs to grow larger. The stronger flocs created by polymer addition may have unintended consequences in subsequent treatment steps. Large strong flocs are great for improved removal in plate or tube settlers. In sedimentation tanks with floc filters they may form sludge that is more difficult to suspend after a brief shutdown. In filters it is possible that large flocs are more rigid and fail to enter the pore spaces of the filter. Thus the use of polymers may require using large media size for depth filtration. The polymers may also form mudballs in granular filters and thus require more aggressive washing.</p>

<h2>Flocculation Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#flocculation-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Particle aggregation is the fundamental mechanism that facilitates ultra low energy and low cost removal of particles and pathogens from water. Aggregation requires successful collisions. Success is defined by particles  attaching when they collide.</p>
<div class="section" id="sticky-coagulant-nanoparticles">
<h3>Sticky Coagulant Nanoparticles<a class="headerlink" href="#sticky-coagulant-nanoparticles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prior to the AguaClara flocculation model it was widely assumed that attachment was made possible by reducing the net surface charge of the particles. The AguaClara flocculation model is based on the understanding that coagulant nanoparticles are sticky and are much larger than the length scale of the repulsive forces due to surface charges. Thus surface charge is largely irrelevant and this explains why particle aggregation begins even with very low dosages of coagulant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="particles-follow-fluid">
<h3>Particles Follow Fluid<a class="headerlink" href="#particles-follow-fluid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The collisions are caused by particles having relative motion due to fluid deformation. Particle trajectories can be different from the fluid trajectory if the density of the fluid and the particle are significantly different and if the viscous effects are small compared with inertial effects (the Stokes number). The motion of primary particles and small flocs in surface water treatment have low Stokes numbers and follow the fluid trajectory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="long-range-transport">
<h3>Long Range Transport<a class="headerlink" href="#long-range-transport" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need to calculate the rate of primary particle collisions. In turbulent flow flocculators the fluid deformation is caused by turbulent eddies that lose their energy to viscosity. The relative motion of particles would appear somewhat random as the small eddies have ever changing orientation and intensity. The result is that primary particles take a long meandering path before they finally approach each other and connect in a final collision. The path of relative motion prior to the collision can be thought of as having two distinct components.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first component is long range transport when the particles are far apart with a separation distance that is proportional to the average distance between particles.</p></li>
<li><p>The second component is the short range transport at length scales less than the average particle separation distance to the final collision</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The AguaClara flocculation model assumes a relatively high velocity and long distance random walk clearing a volume of fluid equal to the volume occupied by a single particle. This is followed by a slow, short, straight walk toward a collision. The insight that the long range transport is the rate limiting step will be used to estimate the time required for particle collisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="primary-particle-attachment">
<h3>Primary Particle Attachment<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-particle-attachment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In our early modeling work we assumed that collisions between primary particles and large flocs were favorable. This assumption led to the prediction that the highest quality water should be obtained when the raw water has the highest turbidity. That prediction is inconsistent with observations and led to the insight that during flocculation, primary particles are only able to collide successfully with other primary particles (or potentially with other very small flocs).</p>
<p>The only transport mechanism that could cause a clay particle to collide with a large floc is the fluid deformation caused by the linear velocity gradient. In our flocculators that linear velocity gradient is caused by turbulent eddies at much larger scales of the flow. We hypothesize that primary particles can not attach to large flocs because primary particles can not collide with large flocs! To understand why this collision is impossible, we need a simple insight.</p>
<p>The insight is that the large flocs drag fluid around as they rotate (due to the linear velocity gradient). The viscous layer around the large flocs creates a flow field in which there is no location far from the flocs that will eventually approach the surface of the flocs or even approach within the clay particle radius. If this is correct, then clay particles never collide with large flocs in a linear velocity gradient flow field.</p>

<p>Particle separation distance matters because it determines which transport mechanisms are at play when two particles approach for a collision. The particle separation distance is a function of the particle concentration. Surface water treatment plants commonly treat water with turbidity between 1 and 1000 NTU.

<p>Given this range of particle separation distances the next question is whether transport of these particles relative to each other is driven by inertial or viscous dominated processes. Turbulent eddies devolve into smaller and smaller eddies until viscosity finally kills them. Viscosity damps out the effects of inertia at the inner viscous length scale.  Higher intensity turbulence can generate more energetic small eddies and can resist the effects of viscosity longer. Thus the inner viscous length scale decreases as the turbulent energy dissipation rate increases.</p>
<p>The Camp-Stein velocity gradient  (see Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Fluid_Deformation_and_Energy_Dissipation/FDED_Derivations.html#equation-g-camp-stein">(90)</a>) used for flocculators varies from about 20 to 300 Hz. We will use the inner viscous length scale, Equation <a class="reference internal" href="../Fluid_Deformation_and_Energy_Dissipation/FDED_Derivations.html#equation-eq-inner-viscous-length">(103)</a> to determine whether viscous or inertial transport dominates particle collisions in surface water treatment given the range of particle separation distances (see <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-lambdaclay-vs-cclay"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 100</span></a>).</p>

<p>By comparing <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-lambdaclay-vs-cclay"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 100</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-innerviscous-vs-g"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 101</span></a> it is apparent that the particle separation distances commonly found in surface water treatment plants are much smaller than the inner viscous length scale for all practical flocculation velocity gradients. Thus viscosity will dominate the flocculation process. This key insight reveals why turbulent flow flocculators have been designed using the dimensionless grouping <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \theta\)</span> which is fundamentally <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt\frac{\epsilon}{\nu} \theta\)</span>. Given that flocculation is viscous dominated implies that the flocculation process will slow down as the temperature increases and the viscosity increases.</p>
<p>The flocculation model (see Equation <a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Model.html#equation-cplamint">(446)</a>) reveals that the velocity gradient multiplied by the residence time in the flocculator will determine the final spacing between the primary particles. Our goal is to maximize the spacing between particles and thus to minimize the number of particles and potential pathogens in our drinking water.</p>
<p>There are diminishing returns on investment in larger flocculators to produce cleaner water because the time between collisions increases as the primary particles are spaced further apart. Eventually other processes  including fluidized floc filters (floc filters), plate settlers, and sand-floc filter (stacked rapid sand filter) are able to reduce the primary particle concentration at a lower cost.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-are-baffles">
<h4><strong>What are Baffles?</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-baffles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now that we know how to measure collision potential with head loss, we need a way to actually generate head loss. While both major or minor losses can be the design basis, it generally makes more sense to use major losses only for very low-flow flocculation (lab-scale) and minor losses for higher flows, as flocculation with minor losses tends to be more space-efficient. Since this book focuses on town and village-scale water treatment (5 L/S to 120 L/S), we will use minor losses as our design basis.</p>
<p>To generate minor losses, we need to create flow expansions. AguaClara does this with <strong>baffles</strong>, which are obstructions in the channel of a flocculator to force the flow to switch directions by 180°. Baffles in AguaClara plants are plastic sheets, and all of the baffles in one flocculator channel are connected to form a <strong>baffle module.</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-ac-flocculator"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 102</span></a> shows an AguaClara flocculator and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-baffle-module"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 103</span></a> shows the assembly of a baffle module.</p>

<p>Since baffles are the source of head loss via minor losses, we need to find the minor loss coefficient of one baffle if we want to be able to quantify its head loss. To do this, we apply fluid mechanics intuition and check it against a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Flow around a 90° bend has a vena contracta value of around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{vc} = 0.62\)</span>. Flow around a 180° bend therefore has a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\color{red}{\Pi_{vc}^{baffle} = \Pi_{vc}^2 = 0.384}\)</span>. This number is roughly confirmed with CFD, as shown in the image below.</p>

<p>We can therefore state with reasonable accuracy that, when most contracted, the flow around a baffle goes through 38.4% of the area it does when expanded, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{contracted} = \Pi_{vc}^{baffle} A_{expanded}\)</span>.

The plant at Gracias revealed that the observed head loss was greater than predicted.  <a class="reference external" href="https://iwaponline.com/aqua/article/47/3/142/31711/Design-of-around-the-end-hydraulic-flocculators">This paper by Haarhoff in 1998</a>  (DOI: 10.2166/aqua.1998.20), the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K_{baffle}\)</span> values found are context dependent and empirically based.

<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-k-baffle-min">(419)</a> doesn’t account for the fact that for a series of baffles (or flow contractions) the flow might not be able to fully expand before entering the next baffle (or contraction). The distance required for the contracted flow to expand can be estimated from jet equations (see section on <a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Derivations.html#heading-baffle-loss-coefficient"><span class="std std-ref">Baffle Minor Loss Coefficient</span></a> for an estimate of how the minor loss coefficient increases when the flow doesn’t fully expand).</p>

<h3>Flocculator Efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#flocculator-efficiency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When designing an effective and efficient flocculator, there are two main problems that we seek to avoid:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Having certain sections in the flocculator with such high local <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> values that our big, fluffy flocs are sheared apart into smaller flocs.</p></li>
<li><p>Having dead space. Dead space means volume within the flocculator that is not being used to facilitate collisions. Dead space occurs after the flow has fully expanded from flowing around a baffle and before it reaches the next baffle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately for us, both problems can be quantified with a single ratio:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-flocculation-floc-intro-3">
<span class="eqno">(420)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-flocculation-floc-intro-3" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}} = \frac{G_{Max}}{G_{CS}}\]</div>
<p>High values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}}\)</span> occur when one or both of the previous problems is present. If certain sections in the flocculator have very high local <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> values, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{Max}\)</span> becomes large. If the flocculator has a lot of dead space, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{CS}\)</span> becomes small. Either way, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}}\)</span> becomes larger.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Recall the relationship between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varepsilon\)</span> : <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G = \sqrt{ \frac{\varepsilon}{\nu} }\)</span>. From this relationship, we can see that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G \propto \sqrt{\varepsilon}\)</span>. Thus, by defining  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}}\)</span>, we can also define a ratio for Max to average energy dissipation rate:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-flocculation-floc-intro-4">
<span class="eqno">(421)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-flocculation-floc-intro-4" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Pi_{\bar \varepsilon}^{\varepsilon_{Max}} = \left( \Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}} \right)^2\]</div>
<p>Therefore, by making our <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}}\)</span> as small as possible, we can be sure that our flocculator is efficient, and we no longer have to account for the previously mentioned problems. <a class="reference external" href="https://iwaponline.com/aqua/article/50/3/149/30498/Towards-optimal-design-parameters-for-around-the">A paper by Haarhoff and van der Walt in 2001</a> (DOI: 10.2166/aqua.2001.0014) uses CFD to show that the minimum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}}\)</span> attainable in a hydraulic flocculator is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4\)</span>, which means that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{\bar \varepsilon}^{\varepsilon_{Max}} = \left( \Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}} \right)^2 \approx 2\)</span>. So how do we optimize an AguaClara flocculator to make sure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{G_{CS}}^{G_{Max}} = \sqrt{2}\)</span>?</p>
<p>We define and optimize a performance metric:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-flocculation-floc-intro-5">
<span class="eqno">(422)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-flocculation-floc-intro-5" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\frac{H_e}{S} = \Pi_{H_eS}\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_e\)</span> is the distance between flow expansions in the flocculator and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> is the spacing between baffles. For now, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_e\)</span> is approximated as the height of water in the flocculator.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{Max}\)</span> is determined by the fluid mechanics of flow around a baffle, our main concern is eliminating dead space in the flocculator. We do this by placing an upper limit on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H_e}{S}\)</span>. To determine this upper limit, we need to find the distance it takes for the flow to fully expand after it has contracted around a baffle. We base this on the rule of thumb for flow expansion, a jet doubles its initial diameter/length once it travels 10 times the distance of its original diameter/length. If this is confusing, refer to the equation and image below:</p>

<p>Using the equation and image above, we can find the distance required for the flow to fully expand around a baffle as a function of baffle spacing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>. We do this by substituting  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{cp} = (0.384 S)\)</span> along with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D = S\)</span> to approximate how much distance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = H_e\)</span>, the contracted flow has to cover.</p>

</div>
<p>In order to have a robust design process for a baffle module, we need to have some flexibility in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS} = \frac{H_e}{S}\)</span> ratio. Since we found <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Max}}\)</span> previously, we must now find the lowest functional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H_e}{S}\)</span> ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Min}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>AguaClara uses a fairly straightforward way of setting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Min}}\)</span>. It is based on the distance between the water level and the bottom baffle (which is the same distance between the flocculator floor and a top baffle). This distance is referred to as the slot width (<a class="reference external" href="http://aqua.iwaponline.com/content/47/3/142">Haarhoff 1998</a>)  DOI: 10.2166/aqua.1998.20”) and is defined by the slot width ratio, which describes the slot width as a function of baffle spacing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>. Slot width is shown in the following image:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id22">
<span id="figure-slot-width-description"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/Slot_width_description.jpg"><img alt="image showing the dimensiond of spacing within the flocculator" src="../_images/Slot_width_description.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 109 </span><span class="caption-text">The space between the bottom of the upper baffle and the floor of the flocculator is defined as the slot width.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id22" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>AguaClara uses a slot width ratio of 1 for its flocculators. This number has been the topic of much hydraulic flocculation research, and values between 1 and 1.5 are generally accepted for hydraulic flocculators. See the following paper and book respectively for more data on slot width ratios and other hydraulic flocculator parameters: <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Design.html#id7"><span>Haa98</span></a>]</span>, <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Design.html#id9"><span>SO84</span></a>]</span>. We base our slot width ratio of 1 on research done by <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="Floc_Design.html#id8"><span>HvdW01</span></a>]</span> on optimizing hydraulic flocculator parameters to maximize flocculator efficiency.</p>
<p>The minimum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS}\)</span> allowable depends on the slot with ratio. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS}\)</span> is less than twice the slot width ratio, the water would flow straight through the flocculator without having to bend around the baffles. This means that the flocculator would not be generating almost any head loss, and the top and bottom of the flocculator will largely be dead space. See the following image for an example:</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id23">
<span id="figure-hes-ratio-min"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/HeS_ratio_min.jpg"><img alt="minimum H S ratio" src="../_images/HeS_ratio_min.jpg" style="width: 600px;" /></a>

</div>
<p>Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Min}}\)</span> should be at least twice the slot width ratio, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Min}} = 2\)</span>. Historically, AguaClara plants have been designed using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Pi_{H_eS_{Min}} = 3\)</span>. This adds a safety factor of sorts, ensuring that the flow does not short-circuit through the flocculator and also allowing more space for the flow to expand after each contraction.</p>

<div class="section" id="obstacles">
<h4>Obstacles<a class="headerlink" href="#obstacles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Knowing that efficient flocculators require an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H_e}{S}\)</span> ratio that lies between 3 and 6, we need to understand how that impacts the flocculator design. Keeping <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H_e}{S}\)</span> between two specific values limits the options for baffle spacing and quantity, due to the flocculator having certain size constraints before beginning the design of the baffles. This limitation places an upper limit on the amount of head loss that a baffled flocculator can generate, since the number of baffles is limited by space and baffles are what cause head loss. This is unfortunate, it means that baffled flocculators under certain size specifications can’t be designed to generate certain values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar \varepsilon\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G_{CS}\)</span> <em>while remaining efficient and maintaining</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 &lt; \Pi_{H_eS} &lt; 6\)</span>. This problem only arises for low flow plants, usually below <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{Plant} = 20 {\rm \frac{L}{s}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, AguaClara included ‘obstacles,’ or half-pipes to contract the flow after the flow expands around one baffle and before it reaches the next baffle. The purpose of these obstacles is to provide extra head loss in between baffles. They also generate head loss via minor losses, and one obstacle is designed to have the same <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> as one baffle. Introducing obstacles slightly alters how we think about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_e\)</span>. In a flocculator where there are just baffles and no obstacles, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_e = H\)</span>, since the height of water in the flocculator is equal to the distance between expansions. When obstacles are added, however, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_e = \frac{H}{1 + n_{obstacles}}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{obstacles}\)</span> is the number of obstacles between two baffles.</p>
<p><strong>Baffle space</strong> is the term we use for the space between two baffles. The number of flow expansions per baffle space is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_{expansions} = 1 + n_{obstacles}\)</span>. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> is because the baffle itself causes a flow expansion.</p>
<p>These obstacles serve as ‘pseudo-baffles’. They allow for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H}{S}\)</span> to exceed 6, while maintaining maximum flocculator efficiency since, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{H_e}{S}\)</span> can still be between 3 and 6. Obstacles make it possible to design smaller flocculators without compromising flocculation efficiency. <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-floc-module-with-obstacles"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 111</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-floc-flow-with-obstacles"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 112</span></a> show these obstacles and how they affect the flow in a flocculator.</p>

<h3>Flocculator Geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#flocculator-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The geometry of hydraulic flocculators changes rather dramatically as the flow rate increases from a fraction of a L/s up to thousands of L/s. The transition from one geometry to another is dependent on economic, fabrication, and integration with the rest of the plant design. Thus the transition flows will evolve as design optimization progresses. Flows between 0.5 L/s and 20 L/s are efficiently handled by a Vertical-Horizontal flow flocculator as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#figure-vhflocculator"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 113</span></a>.</p>
