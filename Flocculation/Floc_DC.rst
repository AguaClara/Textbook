Flocculation Design Challenge
*****************************

1)
~~
How far will two clay particles with a diameter of 5 :math:`\mu m` travel relative to each if they are in a uniform velocity gradient of 100 Hz for 400 s and separated (in the direction of the velocity gradient) by their average separation distance based on a turbidity of 1 NTU? Note that in a uniform velocity gradient :math:`\bar G = G_{CS}`.

2)
~~
Use the flocculation model to estimate the settled water turbidity (assuming no floc blanket) given a surface coverage, :math:`\Gamma = 0.3`, no DOM, a :math:`G_{CS}\theta = 40,000`. Use the model that neglects the initial particle concentration.

3)
~~
A hydraulic flocculator has 50 cm wide channels, an exit water depth of 2 m, a baffle spacing of 40 cm with no intermediate obstacles, and a design temperature of :math:`15^\circ C`.

  #. What is the flow rate that would result in a :math:`G_{CS}` of 100 Hz?
  #. If the :math:`G_{CS}\theta` for the flocculator is 40,000, then what is the total head loss for the flocculator?
  #. How many baffles does the flocculator need?
  #. What is the velocity
  #. If the flow rate is decrease by 50%, then what is the new :math:`G_{CS}` and :math:`G_{CS}\theta` for the flocculator?

4)
~~
A 60 L/s hydraulic flocculator has 63 cm wide channels, an exit water depth of 2 m, a baffle spacing of 39.3 cm with no intermediate obstacles and a total of 63 flow expansions.  Plot :math:`G_{CS}\theta` as a function of temperature from :math:`0^\circ C` to :math:`35^\circ C`.

  #. Why does :math:`G_{CS}\theta` increase with temperature?
  #. How does head loss through a flocculator vary as a function of temperature? Explain why.
