Design information for the AguaClara entrance tank is available in `the Entrance Tank Design chapter of The Physics of Water Treatment Design <https://aguaclara.github.io/Textbook/Flow_Control_and_Measurement/ET_Design.html>`_.

General
-------

Purpose and Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The entrance tank (see :numref:`figure_spec_ET_Diagram_Labeled`) has multiple functions in a drinking water treatment plant:

A. Remove air bubbles to reduce splashing, turbulence, and unsteady motion of the chemical feed surface tracking lever system
B. Remove grit to prevent accumulation in the flocculator
C. Remove leaves and other debris to prevent clogging of the diffusers in the clarifier inlet
D. Dissipate kinetic energy to keep the water level steady for accurate flow measurement
E. Measure the incoming flow rate with the Linear Flow Orifice Meter (LFOM) so that operators can make adjustments and respond to changes in water demand
F. Provide a water surface elevation that is proportional to the plant flow rate that is used to automatically ensure the chemical dosages remain constant even as the plant flow rate varies
G. Inject the coagulant and any other amendments required for flocculation

Flow Path
^^^^^^^^^

Raw water enters the the entrance tank as shown in :numref:`figure_spec_ET_Diagram_Labeled` and flows across the hoppers at the bottom of the tank. The first hopper contains an overflow pipe to waste any water entering the plant in excess of the plant flow rate. The overflow pipe has a nominal diameter of :sub:`($..et.overflow.ND) no-sub` inches, sized to handle the total plant flow rate. A :sub:`($..et.etHopper.drainND) no-sub` inch nominal diameter removable drain pipe stub is installed in each hopper, allowing the operator to discharge accumulated sediment from the hoppers while the plant is in operation.

Trash Rack
----------

Purpose and Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The trash racks are designed to remove any particles that would be large enough to obstruct downstream processes.

Flow Path
^^^^^^^^^
As the raw water flows from the first hopper to the subsequent ones, it must pass through two trash racks, preventing large debris from entering the treatment process. Having two trash racks allows the operator to remove one of the trash racks for cleaning. 

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The smallest flow dimensions are the diffusers in the clarifier with a width of :sub:`($..inletManifold.diffuser.slotW) no-sub` and the orifices in the stacked rapid sand filter inlet branches with a diameter of :sub:`($..filter.fiPipes.branch.inlet.portD) no-sub`. The maximum spacing between the trashrack strings is :sub:`($..trashRack.Sm) no-sub`.

The trash rack area is sufficient such that the fractional clogging can be as high as :sub:`($..et.trashRack.PO_pi) no-sub` before exceeding the maximum available head loss of :sub:`($..et.trashRack.HL_max) no-sub` in the entrance tank.

   String diameter, :sub:`($..et.trashRack.Dm) no-sub`
   Open space between strings, :sub:`($..et.trashRack.Sm) no-sub`


Sediment and Grit Removal
-------------------------

The entrance tank has a capture velocity of :sub:`($..et.captureVm) no-sub` to remove particules that would otherwise settle in the bottom of the flocculator. Large particulates settle out in the hoppers, and collect near the drains at the bottom. 

The entrance tank length of :sub:`($..et.L) no-sub` corresponds to the clarifier tank length. The width, :sub:`($..et.W) no-sub`, ensurse the minimum desired capture velocity is met while still allowing enough space for a person to fit inside and construct the tank.

The :sub:`($..et.etHopper.N) no-sub` hoppers collect sand and grit that then slides to the bottom where the :sub:`($..et.etHopper.drain.ND) no-sub` inch nominal diameter drains are located. When too much sediment has accumulated, the drain pipes must be removed until the sludge is flushed out. Directly below the entrance tank, there is a drain channel that transfers the waste to the main plant drain channel.



Linear Flow Orifice Meter
-------------------------
Purpose and Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Linear Flow Orifice Meter (LFOM) is a weir shape cut into a pipe with rows of holes, or orifices, drilled into it. The LFOM creates a linear relationship between water level in the entrance tank and the flow out of the entrance tank. It does not control the flow through the plant..


This serves two purposes:

#. Allows the operator to measure the flow through the plant quickly and easily.
#. Allows for the Linear Chemical Dose Controller, which will be explained next, to automatically adjust the flow of coagulant and chlorine into the plant as the plant flow rate changes. This means the operators only need to adjust the coagulant when there is a need to change the **dose** due to a change in turbidity or organic matter concentration.
