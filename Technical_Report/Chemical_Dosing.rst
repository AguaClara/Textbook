Chemical Dosing

Purpose and Description
=======================

The coagulation and disinfection processes require the precise dosage of coagulant to the plant influent and calcium hypochlorite to the plant effluent. To carry out this process without pumps, the AguaClara plant uses a hydraulic dosing system.

The main components of the system are:

* Tanks to store the coagulant and chlorine stock solutions
* An elevated platform to support the chemical storage tanks at the correct elevation for gravity powered dosing
* A flow measurement cylinder for each chemical
* A pair of constant level tank with float valves that maintains a constant level for both chemical solutions
* Two sets of tubes that provides the necessary relationship between pressure drop and chemical flow rates for both chemical solutions
* A balance that connects the water level in the plant's inlet tank to the level at the outlet of the chemical dosing system

This system has the characteristic of maintaining a constant chemical **dosage** even as the flow rate through the plant varies. This enables an experienced operator to vary the chemical dosage directly, without doing any calculations, and without having to manipulate the system every time the flow rate in the plant changes. The AguaClara dosing system provides the added benefit of automatically turning off the chemical flow when there is no flow in the plant. This provides security against contamination with excess chemicals and chemical waste in the event that the plant is shut down inadvertently as may occur if the transmission line is damaged.
