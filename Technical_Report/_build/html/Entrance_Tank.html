<h2>Sediment and Grit Removal<a class="headerlink" href="#sediment-and-grit-removal" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Water enters the plant on the left side of the entrance tank shown in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">figure_spec_ET_Diagram_Labeled</span></code> and flows  the top of the inverted pyramidal traps, or hoppers, at the bottom of the tank. The first hopper contains an overflow pipe to waste any water entering the plant in excess of the plant flow rate. The overflow pipe has a nominal diameter of 4 inches, sized to handle the total plant flow rate. A drain pipe stub is installed in each hopper, allowing the operator to . The ND.EtFlowControl nominal diameter drain is designed to handle the drain the full plant flow rate if needed.</p>
<p>Large particulates settle out into the hoppers, and collect near the drains at the bottom. When the water reaches the end of the tank, it flows through the orifices of the riser pipe, which acts as a linear flow orifice meter (LFOM). It is designed for a capture velocity of W.EtCapture to remove these particulates. A length of L.Et is assigned to the entrance tank to correspond to the sedimentation tank length plus enough space to fit the float of the chemical dose controller and the rapid mix pipes. The width, W.Et, is then assigned to ensure the minimum desired capture velocity is met while still allowing enough space for a person to fit inside and construct the tank. The depth of the tank is then determined such that the velocity in the upper rectangular portion of the tank does not exceed the velocity in the flocculator, V.Floc, while ensuring the depth is sufficiently small that the drains are easy to access. In this case, the tank has a height of H.Et.</p>
<p>To allow for easy maintenance, N.EtHoppers hoppers must be built into the entrance tank, at an angle of AN.EtSlope, forcing sediments to slide to the bottom where the ND.EtDrain drains are located. When too much sediment has accumulated, the upper drain pipes must be removed until the sludge is flushed out. Directly below the entrance tank, there is a drain channel to collect the waste.
As the raw water flows from the first hopper to the subsequent ones, it must pass through two trash racks, preventing large debris from entering the treatment process. Having two trash racks allows the plant to run with a grit screen even while the operator cleans one of them. The trash racks are made of rebar and slide into two slots built into the entrance tank wall. The center-to-center distance between the rebar, B.EtRebar m, is set to ensure that debris large enough to clog the orifices in the linear flow orifice meter downstream (LFOM) are kept out.</p>
<p>Suspended particulates in the water settle out over the length of the entrance tank into the hoppers below. When enough sludge has accumulated at the bottom, the hopper stops can be removed to flush out the debris down into the drain channel below, and they can then be replaced to resume normal operation. The ND.EtDrain in nominal diameter hopper stop is L.EtDrainStopper m long, ensuring the top of the pipe is above the maximum water height in the tank. Table 3 summarizes the entrance tank design specifications below.</p>

<span id="title-lfom"></span><h1>Linear Flow Orifice Meter<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-flow-orifice-meter" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The LFOM is a weir shape cut into a pipe. It was meant to imitate <a class="reference external" href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/LFOM+sutro+weir+research">the Sutro Weir</a> while being far easier to build. The LFOM is a pipe with rows of holes, or orifices, drilled into it. There are progressively fewer holes per row as you move up the LFOM, as the shape is meant to resemble half a parabola on each side. The size of all holes is the same, and the amount of holes per row are precisely calculated. Water in the entrance tank flows into and down the LFOM, towards the rapid mix orifice and flocculator.</p>

<span id="figure-sutro-v-lfom"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/sutro_v_lfom.png"><img alt="A sutro weir and an LFOM" src="_images/sutro_v_lfom.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">On the left is a sutro weir. On the right is AguaClara’s approximation of the Sutro weir’s geometry. This elegant innovation is called a linear flow orifice meter, or LFOM for short.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this image"></a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The LFOM does one thing and serves two purposes.</p>
<p>What it does:</p>
<p><strong>The LFOM creates a linear relationship between water level in the entrance tank and the flow out of the entrance tank.</strong> <em>It does not control the flow through the plant</em>. If the LFOM were replaced with a hole in the bottom of the entrance tank, the same flow rate would go through the plant, the only difference being that the water level in the entrance tank would scale with flow squared <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h \propto Q^2\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h \propto Q\)</span>. For example, if an LFOM has 10 rows of holes and has been designed for a plant whose maximum flow rate is 10 L/s, then the operator knows that the number of rows submerged in water is equal to the flow rate of the plant in L/s. So if the water were up to the third row of holes, there would be 3 L/s of water flowing through the plant.</p>
<p>Why it is useful:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Allows the operator to measure the flow through the plant quickly and easily, explained above.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for the Linear Chemical Dose Controller, which will be explained next, to automatically adjust the flow of coagulant/chlorine into the plant as the plant flow rate changes. This means the operator would only need to adjust the flow of coagulant when there is a change in turbidity or organic matter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is best understood with examples. By shaping a weir differently, different relationships between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> are formed:
* In the case of a <a class="reference external" href="https://swmm5.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/image00124.jpg">rectangular weir</a>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q \propto h^{\frac{3}{2}}\)</span>
* In the case of a <a class="reference external" href="https://swmm5.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/image0096.jpg">v-notch weir</a>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q \propto h^{\frac{5}{2}}\)</span>
* In the case of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engineeringexcelspreadsheets.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Sutro-Weir-Diagram1.jpg">Sutro weir</a> and thus LFOM, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q \propto h\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before the water level reaches the second row of holes, the LFOM is simulating a rectangular weir, and thus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h \not\propto Q\)</span>. The Sutro weir also experiences this problem. Similarly, if the water level exceeds the topmost row of the LFOM’s orifices, the linearity also breaks down. The entire LFOM begins to act like an orifice, the exponent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h \propto Q\)</span> becomes greater than 1. This is because the LFOM approaches orifice behavior, and for orifices, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h \propto Q^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The diameter of the LFOM pipe is set by the velocity of the falling water inside the LFOM at the bottom of the bottom row of orifices. This velocity is obtained by summing up all of the momentum of the falling water and dividing by the total flow for the case where the LFOM is operating at maximum capacity. The Sutro weir equations (not yet provided here) can be integrated to obtain an equation for the falling velocity of the water inside the LFOM. This maximum vertical velocity of the falling water sets the minimum flow area of the LFOM and hence continuity can be used to obtain the minimum pipe diameter.</p>
