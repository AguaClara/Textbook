Stacked Rapid Sand Filter
*************************


Design information for the AguaClara Stacked Rapid Sand Filter (StaRS) is available in `the Open Stacked Rapid Sand Filter Design chapter of The Physics of Water Treatment Design <https://aguaclara.github.io/Textbook/Filtration/Filtration_Design.html>`_


Purpose and Description
=======================

The StaRS filter removes particles and pathogens from the clarified water. The StaRS filter was designed to eliminate the need for pumps and storage tanks that are normally required for backwashing rapid sand filters. The StaRS filter has the same flow rate in filtration mode and in backwash mode. An elegant filter hydraulic design enables switching from filtration mode to backwash mode without using any large diameter valves. Backwash is accomplished using clarified water and that increases the efficiency of water production by the AguaClara plant. 

The hydraulic controls are on the main plant floor and are open so that the plant operators can readily observe head loss through the filter as well as the clarity of the clarified and filtered water. 

The plan view of the filter (:numref:`figure_filter_top`) shows the filter chambers and the hydraulic controls separated by a walkway.

    Filter top view showing filter hydraulic controls and filter chambers for a 2 filter chamber design.

The isometric side view of the filter (:numref:`figure_filter_isometric`) with the filter wall and backwash tank wall removed shows the filter internal piping as well as the pipes that connect the filter controls to the filter chamber.

    :alt: filter isometric view

    Filter isometric view showing filter hydraulic controls and filter chambers for a 2 filter chamber design.

The section view cutting through the center of the first filter chamber (:numref:`figure_filter_left_section_isometric`) shows that the center of the filter controls inlet tank is aligned with the center of the filter chamber. Thus the four inlet pipes have a straight path into the filter chamber. The outlet pipes have a 45° elbow to account for the offset to the filter controls outlet tank.   

.. _figure_filter_left_section_isometric:

    :alt: filter left section isometric view

    Filter left section isometric view showing how the inlet tank, filter chamber, and siphon pipe are all aligned. The different heights of the inlet pipe stubs in the inlet tank are also shown.

The filter controls (:numref:`figure_filter_controls_top_isometric`) provide the operator with a method to rapidly confirm filter operation. The filter controls come in pairs when there is more than one filter chamber so they can share the finished water tank.

Water flows from right to left from the inlet channel, over the wide weir to the bypass channel. During normal operation the water enters the LFOM and flows into the filter controls inlet tank (:numref:`figure_filter_controls_inlet_tank`). If there is a need to bypass a filter the LFOM and bypass pipe stubs are simply swapped. During backwash the gate can be removed so that the filter receives the design flow rate. The filter controls inlet tank has an overflow that dumps water to the backwash tank when the head loss through the filter exceeds the maximum design value. The bubble weir raises bubbles to minimize their entry into the filter inlets. The short pipe stubs in the filter inlets ensure that the water all enters the backwash inlet during backwash. The different heights of the pipe stubs causes the filter sand to fluidize gradually starting from the sand near the top of the filter and progressing deeper as more of the water is forced into the bottom inlets.

    Filter controls inlet tank. The backwash orifice plate is in place for filtration mode. 

Water exits the filter chamber through three outlet pipes and then enters the filter controls outlet tank (:numref:`figure_filter_controls_outlet_tank_section`). After backwash the red pipe stub can be removed as shown in the foreground outlet tank to enable filtering to waste. When not filtering to waste the water flows over the filtered water weir into the finished water tank and finally into the finished water pipe.


.. _figure_filter_controls_outlet_tank_section:

    :alt: filter controls outlet tank section

    Filter controls outlet tank section showing water levels. The outlet tank in the foreground has the pipe stub that enables filter to waste removed. The outlet tank in the background has the pipe stub in place to prevent filtering to waste.

The filter chamber internal piping (:numref:`figure_filter_internal_piping_isometric`) serves to divide the sand bed into :sub:`($..filter.layerN) no-sub` layers. The  with flow through each layer alternates direction with the bottom layer flowing upward and the next layer flowing downward. 

.. _figure_filter_internal_piping_isometric:

.. figure:: Images/filter_internal_piping_isometric.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: filter internal piping isometric

    Filter internal piping showing how the modules, siphon, and filter drain are placed in the filter chamber.


The filter internal piping consists of 7 modules (:numref:`figure_filter_internal_piping_modules`) for easy assembly in the filter chamber. Each module stacks on top of the module below. The tie-down cable ensures that the modules can not shift relative to each other and it also clamps the entire set of modules in place to prevent uplift during backwash initiation. 
    

.. _figure_filter_internal_piping_modules:

.. figure:: Images/filter_internal_piping_modules.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: filter internal piping modules

    Filter internal piping modules showing how the modules stack, are prevented from lifting by cables anchored to the concrete slab, and attach to the pipes embedded in the filter chamber wall.

The main trunk pipe (:numref:`figure_filter_trunk_isometric`) in each module is connected to the embedded pipe that connects to either the filter control inlet tank or filter control outlet tank. The pipe connections is a stainless steel band that is then held in place with two hose clamps. The ports for the branches slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the branches so that the molded end of the branches can only be inserted a fixed distance into the trunk. 

.. _figure_filter_trunk_isometric:

    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: filter trunk isometric

    Filter inlet trunk isometric showing the ports for the branches and the band clamp system that attaches to a pipe embedded in the filter chamber wall.

The :sub:`($..filter.layerH) no-sub` spacing of the trunks and receptors is set by the spacers (:numref:`figure_filter_trunk_spacer_front_and_top`). The cable grooves alternate sides on the spacers so that the cables prevent the spacers from moving. The spacers are attached to the trunks and receptors.

    Filter trunk spacer front and top views.

The receptors (:numref:`figure_filter_receptor_isometric`) are symmetrical and have PVC disks that plug both ends. The compact design of the PVC disks enables the first and last branches to be relatively close to the filter chamber walls.

.. figure:: Images/filter_receptor_isometric.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: filter receptor isometric

    Filter inlet receptor isometric showing the end plug and the ports for the branches.

There are three types of inlet branches (:numref:`figure_filter_inlet_branches`). The bottom backwash branches have the most orifices to be able to handle the high backwash flow rate. This results in the backwash branches having insufficient head loss during normal filtration. To accommodate the low backwash branch head loss an orifice plate is added to the backwash inlet during filtration. The middle two inlet modules both deliver clarified water to two sand layers and thus should have at least twice as many orifices as the top inlet branches. The middle inlets need even more orifices to account for the added head loss in the inner trunks given that the inner trunks have double the flow rate of the top and bottom trunks during filtration.
