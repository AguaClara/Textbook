Can we make some sort of a diagnostic guide based on symptoms? Make the following into a giant table.





Problems
---------


Temperature fluctuations

Calcium from calcium hypochlorite combines with carbonate in the water to form low solubility calcium carbonate.


Solutions
---------

Drip chlorine into water rather than injecting it to eliminate formation of precipitate at the injection point

Use valves at the end of the pipeline to control transmission line flow rate rather than upstream control. Review the transmission line to ensure that all sections of the line have flow controlled by limiting available driving head. Air entrainment occurs when the available head exceeds the head required to transmit the target flow.

   Air bubbles, Air entrainment in the transmission line and transport to a high pressure zone in the pipeline where the air is dissolved in the water.
   Bubbles in sedimentation tanks,
   Bubbles in EStaRS, water entering the plant is supersaturated with air and EStaRS filters operate at very low pressure (compared with OStaRS), eliminate air entrainment in transmission line
    , , add a unit process (TBD) that removes excess dissolved air
   Rising flocs,
   Short filter runtimes, poor performance of floc/sed system
   Gradual increase in post backwash head loss in filters,
   Scale deposition in the distribution system,
   Clogging of chlorination system tubes and formation of precipitate at the injection point,
